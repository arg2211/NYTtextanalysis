Donald J. Trump, trailed by Secret Service agents, police officers, employees, photographers and golf reporters, was making his way toward him. McIlroy, a native of Northern Ireland, had begun his week at the Cadillac Championship fielding a local television news reporter's question about whether it was a distraction dealing with the ''political shenanigans'' stemming from having a World Golf Championships event at a resort owned by a presidential candidate. ''He's not going to be the leader of my country,'' McIlroy said, adding, ''It doesn't bother me too much.'' McIlroy, who led by three after 54 holes, sure looked bothered once he was out on the Blue Monster course. One of the game's longest hitters, McIlroy did not make a birdie on any of the par 5s in the final round (he played them in nine under in the first three rounds). ''That's really what killed me today,'' said McIlroy, who was the last of the 65 players in the field to record a birdie Sunday. He made a seven-foot putt for a 3 at the 305-yard 16th, on his way to a closing two-over 74 and a tie for third with the Englishman Danny Willett (69). Trump also shook hands and held a brief conversation with Dustin Johnson, the only other player on the range when he blew through. Johnson, the defending champion, closed with a 79, suggesting that not everything touched by Trump, the real estate mogul turned Republican presidential front-runner, turns to gold. After making the turn in one over, Johnson recorded double bogeys on three of the next four holes to flirt with joining five players who shot worse than a 79 on a cool, blustery final round. The Australian Adam Scott briefly entertained the nightmarish thought that he might end up with a score in the 80s. Somehow he instead became the tour's first multiple winner of the wraparound season with a closing three-under 69 in a fitful wind. ''It was ugly and good all in 18 holes,'' said Scott, who fell six strokes behind McIlroy with 13 holes to play after finding water hazards on the third and fifth holes, leading to double bogeys. He played the back nine in four under to win for the second time in two weeks. With a 72-hole total of 12 under, Scott finished one stroke ahead of Bubba Watson, last month's Northern Trust Open champion, who closed with a 68 in his bid to win consecutive starts. It was Scott's 13th tour victory and his first back-to-back titles since the end of 2013, when he won the Australian Masters and the Australian PGA Championship. He fell short of the Australian Triple Crown when he lost to McIlroy at the Australian Open. ''After the second double bogey, winning was kind of far from the front of my mind,'' Scott said. ''At that point, I took a moment to think about kind of just gaining some traction on the round before it slips away, and I shoot 80.'' He added, ''It's just bizarre because I hit some horrible shots today.'' Scott laughed. ''I think you have this picture in your mind that you've got to play so beautifully to win all the time, and sometimes, especially at a golf course like this, in windy conditions like this, it can't be that pretty.'' As a concession, Trump did not take part in the award ceremony, delegating the photo opportunity to his son Eric. Trump was making his first appearance of the week at this World Golf Championships event, for which he serves as the unofficial host. He was fresh from a day spent campaigning and a night in which he tracked results from four states with Republican contests from a golf course he owns in West Palm Beach. He came wearing a white billed cap emblazoned with his campaign creed, ''Make America Great Again.'' He said, ''Today I'm going to try to spend some relaxing time.'' He quickly amended himself. ''But it's not going to happen,'' Trump said, noting that he had a 52-person Secret Service detail, which restricted his ability to wade into the galleries to shake hands, hold babies, pose for selfies and track players' shots. It is the last year for Cadillac as the title sponsor, and the tournament's future is unclear. Trump has waged a presidential campaign that has created a disconnect with a sport striving to become more inclusive. He insisted his relationship with the PGA Tour was ''very good,'' adding: ''I'm also a front-runner. Being a front-runner, people like you more. Trump was three minutes into an impromptu interview on the range when a Hispanic woman's voice rose above the din of the crowd behind the range that was vying for Trump's attention. ''Mr. Trump, Sign for the Latina woman here,'' Melida Demorizi said. ''I love you. Sign my shirt.'' Trump was happy to oblige her. At a campaign rally last fall here, he was interrupted by protesters who took exception to disparaging comments he had made about Mexicans. Trump walked over and signed the back of Demorizi's pink shirt, then returned to his interviews. ''I've lived here 39 years, and I'm getting my citizenship because of Mr. Trump,'' said Demorizi, who said she planned to sit for her interview this month and then participate in the United States naturalization ceremony. Wherever Trump went on the grounds Sunday, he was followed by screaming fans. Around dinnertime, more shrieking was heard in the hallway outside a ballroom in the main building of the resort. But Trump was nowhere to be found. Scott was at the center of the frenzy.

2,The New York Times,7-Mar-16,Obama Pays Tribute to the 'Peanuts' Gang,Late Edition - Final,,,By GEORGE GENE GUSTINES,ENGLISH,,,UNITED STATES (93%),Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 5,,Newspaper,,BARACK OBAMA (91%),756 words,"PHOTO: The 25th volume of ''The Complete Peanuts,'' a series published over 12 years. (PHOTOGRAPH BY FANTAGRAPHICS BOOKS)",10-Mar-16,,,,US PRESIDENTS (90%); BOOK REVIEWS (77%); VISUAL ARTISTS (63%); COLORECTAL CANCER (50%),"''Like millions of Americans, I grew up with 'Peanuts.' But I never outgrew it.'' So begins the foreword written by President Obama for the 25th volume of ''The Complete Peanuts,'' the latest in a series of hardcover books reprinting every daily and Sunday strip of the iconic series that appeared from 1950 to 2000. The volume, which is scheduled for release in May, covers Jan. 1, 1999, through Feb. 13, 2000, when the final ''Peanuts'' strip was published the day after the death of its creator, Charles M. Schulz. ''For decades, 'Peanuts' was our own daily security blanket,'' President Obama writes in his introduction. ''That's what makes 'Peanuts' an American treasure.'' No one would agree with that assessment more than Gary Groth, the president and co-founder of Fantagraphics Books, which has been publishing ''The Complete Peanuts'' since 2004. Mr. Groth wanted to make sure this volume was special, beginning with the introduction -- and who was going to write it. ''Obama was inevitably at the top of the list,'' he said. ''Let's just reach for the stars. All he can do is say no.'' Jake Tapper of CNN, who wrote the foreword to Vol. 22, put Mr. Groth in contact with the White House and the request eventually found its way to the president. ''It was a great day when we got the word that he agreed do it,'' Mr. Groth said. The idea for the collected editions came to Mr. Groth in 1997, when he interviewed Mr. Schulz for The Comics Journal, a trade magazine. ''Previously 'Peanuts' had been collected only in sporadic volumes: thematically or randomly,'' Mr. Groth said. ''Maybe someone should publish a uniform series,'' he recalled suggesting to Mr. Schulz. ''And that someone could be me,'' he added. Mr. Schulz resisted at first, but eventually gave his consent. Still, the project did not really take shape until after his death, from colon cancer. Mr. Groth credits the cartoonist's widow, Jeannie Schulz, for cutting through the red tape involved with securing the publication rights to make the series possible. Still, a series of hardcover reprints was not a safe bet. Previous collected editions of Prince Valiant, Pogo, Popeye and others ''were almost always a hard sell,'' Mr. Groth said. ''There was no market for newspaper strip reprints. You were really targeting the hard-core comics and cartoon aficionados.'' But ''The Complete Peanuts'' found an audience. Fantagraphics has produced two volumes a year, each selling around 15,000 to 20,000 copies, Mr. Groth said, followed by another 20,000 for a boxed set every holiday season combining the year's releases. While the 25th volume wraps up the daily newspaper strips, it also includes a look back. It reprints ''Li'l Folks,'' the weekly comic from Mr. Schulz published from 1947 to 1950, which was a forerunner to ''Peanuts.'' The final ''Complete Peanuts'' volume, due in October, will provide something different: a collection of stories and drawings that appeared outside the comic strip. ''It is a real treasure trove of little-seen and never before reprinted work -- all drawn by the hand of Charles Schulz,'' Mr. Groth said. In 2005 ''The Complete Peanuts'' won two Eisner Awards, the comic book industry's equivalent of an Oscar, for best archival collection (which it won again in 2007) and for best publication design -- no doubt thanks to the evocative covers by the artist known as Seth, each featuring a gray-toned close-up of one of the ''Peanuts'' gang as drawn by Mr. Schulz. The series also paved the way for other lavish and comprehensive reprint editions including ''The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,'' by Bill Watterson. But the biggest impact of ''The Complete Peanuts'' was on Fantagraphics. ''We're an independent publisher: We have no backers, no investors. We have only the books we publish and our wits to fall back on,'' Mr. Groth said. ''We found ourselves in periodic financial crises. We published the 'Peanuts' right in the nick of time. It changed the fortunes of the company by allowing the company to continue to exist.'' President Obama joins an eclectic group of ''Complete Peanuts'' foreword writers, including Garrison Keillor, Jonathan Franzen, Diana Krall, John Waters, Billie Jean King, Alec Baldwin and Patton Oswalt. ''Whoopi Goldberg was terrific,'' Mr. Groth said. ''Some celebrities -- especially the ones who turned us down -- not so much.'' Mr. Groth's experience with President Obama was very satisfying, he said: ''It's great to tell the president, 'We need it by this date. Don't be late.'

3,The New York Times,7-Mar-16,"A Singer, Once Headed for Big Things, Emerges From His Slumber",Late Edition - Final,,,By JIM FARBER,ENGLISH,,,,Section C; Column 0; The Arts/Cultural Desk; Pg. 4,,Newspaper,,,914 words,PHOTO: Emitt Rhodes (PHOTOGRAPH BY GREG ALLEN),10-Mar-16,,,,MUSIC (90%); SINGERS & MUSICIANS (90%); POP & ROCK (89%); SONG WRITING (89%); INTERVIEWS (77%); ARTS FESTIVALS & EXHIBITIONS (73%); FESTIVALS (73%); NOVELS & SHORT STORIES (60%),"When the Bangles formed in the 1980s, the band sought out an ace melodist to produce its music: Emitt Rhodes. ''We hunted him down at his house, like little Nancy Drews,'' the group's lead singer, Susanna Hoffs, recently recalled. Mr. Rhodes, a thwarted '70s power-pop singer and songwriter, wasn't exactly welcoming. ''He didn't know what to make of us,'' she said. ''And he seemed a bit sad and bitter. So we skulked away, rejected.'' Twenty years later, another young songwriter, Chris Price, made a similar attempt. Based on a tip from a woman he'd met online who said she was concerned about Mr. Rhodes's health, Mr. Price showed up unannounced at his idol's modest house in the Hawthorne area of Los Angeles and found a groggy man in his pajamas. The younger musician recalled Mr. Rhodes greeting him with, ''Who the hell are you?'' Mr. Price said he told Mr. Rhodes his friends were worried about him. ''And, also, that I'd love to leave my CD. He told me, 'If I like it, I'll call. If not, you'll never hear from me again.' '' Fifteen minutes later, Mr. Rhodes called to invite Mr. Price, then 21, over for a drink. That began a close friendship that involved chatting about every subject save one: the pop career Mr. Rhodes abandoned in 1973, at age 23. ''The fact that he never wanted to talk about it spoke volumes to me about how upsetting it was to him,'' Mr. Price said. That pattern of blithe banter went on for seven years until one day in 2013, when Mr. Rhodes suddenly produced for his acolyte a series of envelopes. ''Each one had a song title written on it,'' Mr. Price recalled. ''Inside each were multiple lyrics sheets with a chord chart or two, and a demo tape.'' For Mr. Price, and other power pop votaries, this was roughly akin to a fiction lover suddenly receiving a fresh trove of short stories from J. D. Salinger. ''I found a new inspiration for songs,'' Mr. Rhodes, now 66, said in a phone interview, explaining his revived productivity. ''It was a spurt. And, boy, once it started, it just kept going until I finished.'' His gush eventually resulted in an album titled ''Rainbow Ends'' (Omnivore Recordings), which represents the first new release from Mr. Rhodes in 43 years. Mr. Rhodes will test out performing again by appearing at the South by Southwest music festival on March 19. Mr. Rhodes's voice has deepened from a McCartney-esque chirp to a world-weary huff, falling between Warren Zevon and Jackson Browne. His new lyrics also have more gravity yet the songs retain their impeccable form and fine hooks. Those qualities, first heard on Mr. Rhodes's self-titled debut in 1970, established him as a pioneer of the power pop genre, along with acts including Big Star, Badfinger and the Raspberries. Because Mr. Rhodes assembled his music entirely himself -- and because of the songs' sterling Britpop sheen and painstaking arrangements -- he became known as ''the one-man Beatles.'' Mr. Rhodes made waves when ''Fresh As a Daisy,'' his single on ABC-Dunhill Records, flirted with the Top 50, pushing his album to No. 29. His old record company, A&M, which owned recordings from his former band, the Merry-Go-Round, and the masters of his early solo songs jumped on the bandwagon and released a cobbled-together album under the star's name titled ''The American Dream.'' That record confused the public and blunted sales of Mr. Rhodes's self-titled release. At the same time, Mr. Rhodes's meticulous one-man recording style made it difficult to fulfill his contract for two albums per year. ABC sued him for falling behind schedule and Mr. Rhodes quit cutting his own records, though he continued to work behind the scenes. He became a staff producer at Elektra Records and engineered a novelty single by the ''Welcome Back Kotter'' star Gabe Kaplan titled ''Up Your Nose.'' Mr. Rhodes also indulged in the hedonism of the day. ''It was a lot of drugs, booze and women,'' he said. After that phase ended, he built and rented out a recording studio in the home he has occupied for the past 35 years, across the street from where he grew up. Over the years, Mr. Rhodes had some aborted projects, including, in 1999, a contract with a label that went belly up before he got to work. Some of the songs from that era were greatly reworked for ''Rainbow Ends.'' Mr. Price said the new album didn't aim to recreate the jaunty style of Mr. Rhodes's early work, but to pick up where his last record, 1973's ''Farewell to Paradise,'' left off. And this time, Mr. Rhodes didn't record alone: Mr. Price recruited a wealth of fans for the effort, including members of Jellyfish and the New Pornographers as well as Ms. Hoffs and Aimee Mann. ''Emitt didn't know all these people for whom he was the godfather,'' Mr. Price said. The core band recorded in Mr. Rhodes's home studio, so long unused it appeared like the lair of Rip Van Winkle. ''It was a time capsule of the '70s,'' Mr. Price said. ''It was all shag carpet with this amazing console that existed only back then, and a washing-machine-sized tape player that wasn't working. But the mikes were great and it had his upright piano from his first record.'' Now that his first album in nearly a half-century is out, Mr. Rhodes isn't sure if he'll record again, or whether he'll play many live dates. But, he insists, he doesn't regret all the time gone by, especially given his pride over his new work. ''The songs feel like they've been around forever,'' he said. ''They're eternal.''

He was 86. His death was announced by his wife, Alice, on his website. Mr. Harnoncourt, a cellist, founded the period-instrument ensemble Concentus Musicus Wien -- with his wife as concertmaster -- in 1953, and it remained crucial to his performance activities even as orchestral conducting came to dominate. He announced his retirement from performance last December, citing inadequate ''bodily strength.'' ''I hate specialists,'' Mr. Harnoncourt said in 1996 in an interview at his home in the Austrian Alps near Salzburg, where he had amassed a valuable collection of musical instruments. Call him a specialist or not, and not to deny his multifarious other activities, he researched, performed and recorded early music encyclopedically. In the 1970s and '80s he and the Concentus took part in a complete recording of the nearly 200 surviving Bach sacred cantatas for the Teldec label, sharing the performances with the Dutch harpsichordist Gustav Leonhardt and his Leonhardt Consort. Both leaders used small choruses of men and boys and boy soloists. Mr. Leonhardt's performances showed a certain gentleness, whereas Mr. Harnoncourt's were more assertive, with phrasings and accentuations that sometimes bordered on mannerism. Nikolaus Harnoncourt was born on Dec. 6, 1929, in Berlin to an aristocratic family with roots in Belgium, Luxembourg and France. He was raised in Graz, Austria, and trained in Vienna. In Graz he became a member of the Hitler Youth. ''If you didn't go there every Wednesday and Saturday,'' he said, ''the Hitler Youth police would come, fetch you, cut your hair and toss you into a group with other difficult ones who were treated terribly.'' In Vienna, he played early on with the Vienna State Opera Orchestra. He liked to tell of his first experience there, a late assignment to play Strauss's ''Salome,'' with its difficult parts for the cellos, which he had never seen, under the redoubtable conductor Karl Bohm. ''The whole one and a half hours was a nightmare,'' he said. ''To this day I don't know what happened. But I must have done something correct, because the orchestra invited me again and again after that.'' Mr. Harnoncourt was a cellist in the Vienna Symphony Orchestra from 1952 to 1969, when the Concentus became central to his activities, as it remained. His recording of Beethoven's Fourth and Fifth Symphonies with the Concentus was recently released. He typically directed the Concentus from the cello and conducted larger pieces. As his podium career expanded, Mr. Harnoncourt led a Mozart cycle at the Vienna State Opera and a Monteverdi cycle at the Zurich Opera. His early signal successes as an orchestral conductor included a Mozart symphony series with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. As with his Bach style, his way with Mozart was distinctive: strong, almost militaristic at times. Yet he was eager to talk about the music with his musicians. ''When I sat in an orchestra, I always had this great question in my head, Why?'' Mr. Harnoncourt said. ''I think a musician has a right to get an answer to this question.'' In both operatic and orchestra repertory, he moved seamlessly into later eras, traveling as far afield from the European Baroque as Gershwin's ''Porgy and Bess,'' which he led at the Styriarte Festival in Graz in 2009 with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe. ''Lots of musicians said: 'Don't. You don't have the right blood,' '' Mr. Harnoncourt said. ''But Gershwin was Russian. Why should I understand his music any less than Dvorak?'' Besides his wife, he is survived by three children, including a noted mezzo-soprano, Elisabeth von Magnus. Mr. Harnoncourt worked regularly with many of Europe's major orchestras, including the Vienna Philharmonic and Berlin Philharmonic. His relationship with the Vienna Philharmonic became especially close, as he conducted its televised New Year's concerts in 2001 and 2003. He also conducted the orchestra's annual weekend of concerts at Carnegie Hall in 2003. ''I've never had a medium orchestra in my life,'' he said a dozen years ago. ''That's a gift.''

And they are about to get some company. A new trade group, the Plant Based Foods Association, has been established to represent makers of proteins derived from peas, soybeans and other nonmeat sources. ''We're joining the barnyard,'' said Michele Simon, a public health lawyer and food policy advocate who is founding the new group, which is starting out with 23 companies including old-timers like Tofurky and newcomers like New Wave Foods that all make protein products from plants. Sales of products incorporating plant proteins grew 8.7 percent over 2014 and 2015 through retailers not including Whole Foods, while overall sales of food products grew 3.7 percent, according to Spins, which collects data on retail sales for the natural and specialty products industries. Dozens of companies have sprung up to develop foods from plant-derived proteins, and some have caught the attention of venture capital firms. Califia Farms, which makes plant-based ''milks'' and is a member of the trade group, got $50 million from a single investor, according to CrunchBase. ''At the highest level, we're seeing a pretty substantial shift in consumer interest in plant-based diets,'' said Jeff Dunn, president of the fresh division of Campbell's Soup. ''That's manifesting itself in lots of interest in plant-based protein among companies like us and how it can be used in production.'' Mr. Dunn says consumer interest in plant proteins is driven by a number of factors, including a belief that they are more healthy and have less impact on the environment than meat. This month, Campbell, which is not a member of the new trade group, is introducing new flavors of juices, three from its Bolthouse Farms brand and three from its 1915 brand, and will note on the packages that they contain plant proteins. ''The challenge with pea proteins was getting the perfect texture and mouthfeel,'' said Scott LaPorta, president of Bolthouse. Elizabeth Kucinich, wife of the former congressman and presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich, will represent the Plant Based Foods Association in Washington, and she said it planned to represent a range of companies, not just those whose entire product line is built on plant proteins. Ms. Kucinich has already participated in discussions about food policy in Congress and written a letter to the Agriculture Department expressing disappointment over the failure to include a clear recommendation on reducing red meat consumption in the new dietary guidelines. In general, she said, her goal was to ''level the playing field'' so that plant-based foods got the same consideration as meats in debates about school lunches, dietary recommendations and even environmental issues. ''It's really to make sure we have a seat at the table,'' Ms. Kucinich said. The association will probably lobby, for instance, for federal subsidies for plant-based milks to be served in school lunchrooms. (Schools are currently reimbursed only for serving dairy milk.) And it will take on the Food and Drug Administration's ''standards of identity,'' which prescribe what ingredients and in what quantities are needed to, say, call cheese ''cheese'' on packaging and labels. Miyoko Schinner, founder of Miyoko's Kitchen, ran into exactly that problem when she began selling ''cheese'' made from nut proteins. She was careful not to use the word ''cheese'' on her packaging, instead giving her products names like Aged English Sharp Farmhouse and High Sierra Rustic Alpine, but the California Department of Public Health raised questions. ''I chose language to evoke a feeling of cheddar, adjectives that would bring it to mind, and they said you can't do that, it isn't cheese,'' Ms. Schinner said. ''They kept saying it's not cheese -- so what is it?'' The regulators eventually decided to allow her to call it a ''cultured nut product.'' Now that the trade association has been formed, she says she has begun using the word ''cheese'' on her website and Facebook page. ''The face of food is changing, how we make food and the origins of it,'' she said. ''It's time for the regulatory system to catch up.''

Now they're expected to provide money, too. In today's exploding art market, amid diminishing corporate donations and mounting exhibition costs, nonprofit museums have been leaning more heavily on commercial galleries for larger amounts of money -- anywhere from $5,000 to $200,000 each time -- to help pay for shows featuring work by artists the galleries represent. The increasingly common arrangement has stoked concerns about conflicts of interest and the dilution of a museum's mission to present art for art's sake. Such cozy situations raise the specter of a pay-to-play model and could give galleries undue influence over what the public sees. ''It's really gotten out of hand,'' said Lawrence Luhring of the Luhring Augustine gallery. ''It's the brazenness of it -- just the expectation of 'How are you going to contribute?' '' Others say the galleries, which generally earn between 20 percent and 50 percent commission on each sale, shouldn't complain, because the prestige of museum shows raises the value of an artist's work, boosting gallery profits. ''Museums are giving these galleries the best platform in the art world for free, where they can sell work to their clients on the walls of the greatest museums,'' said Jeffrey Deitch, the longtime dealer and former director of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. ''If the galleries can contribute, why not?'' Maxwell Anderson, who has served as the director of institutions like the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Dallas Museum of Art, said: ''Gallery-supported exhibitions commingle inventory that may be for sale with museum inventory. The self-interest of the gallery can compromise the independence and integrity of the curatorial voice.'' Examples of gallery support abound. For the Whitney's recent popular Frank Stella retrospective, the installation of two outdoor sculptures was made possible in part by funds from the Marianne Boesky and Dominique Lévy galleries, which jointly represent Mr. Stella. In listing contributors to its current exhibition on the New-York-based German photographer Vera Lutter, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, names the Gagosian Gallery, which represents Ms. Lutter. And when the Los Angeles County Museum of Art mounted a Pierre Huyghe show two years ago -- billed as the first major retrospective of that French artist's work -- sponsors included the Marian Goodman Gallery, which represents Mr. Huyghe. ''Ten years ago, museums rarely, if ever, asked galleries to support their artists' museum exhibitions,'' said Lucy Mitchell-Innes of Mitchell-Innes & Nash, who said her gallery is called on to support museum shows once or twice a month for $5,000 to $50,000. ''Galleries are now regularly asked to support their artists' museum exhibitions,'' she said. The gallery payments, which museums generally tailor to a dealer's financial capacity, are directed toward expenses like opening-night dinners, catalogs, shipping, even the costs associated with an artist's creating new work for a show. ''The only thing I have not been asked for is postage,'' said Angela Westwater of the Sperone Westwater Gallery, who said she regularly has to pony up money to museums, with $10,000 being the low end. ''Certainly this can be onerous and complicated for many reasons, including potential conflicts of interest.'' Museums have long turned to outside support for their exhibitions, namely corporations and collectors. But as the cost of mounting shows has grown -- a result of increasingly pricey line items like insurance -- museums have also sought galleries' financial help. And some worry that museums now favor shows by artists represented by galleries with the deepest pockets. Nearly a third of the major solo exhibitions at museums in the United States between 2007 and 2013 featured artists represented by just five galleries, according to a recent survey by the The Art Newspaper: Gagosian, Pace, Marian Goodman, David Zwirner and Hauser & Wirth. These findings ''raise questions about the growing influence of a small number of galleries in a rapidly consolidating art market,'' The Art Newspaper said, ''especially when they often offer logistical and financial support for exhibitions.'' Over all, dealers say they have come to accept this practice as simply another cost of doing business -- like setting up shop in the mushrooming number of international art fairs (going rate: $100,000) -- and part of their obligation to their artists. ''As funding sources become tougher for exhibitions, museums have an expectation that galleries will assist in identifying potential funders as well as making outright or in-kind contributions,'' the dealer James Cohan said. ''It's in our artists' best interest to support these projects.'' He added: ''Gallery involvement in museum exhibitions is part of the ecosystem of the art world. The competition to get one's artist seen in a noncommercial context like a museum or international survey is quite intense but ultimately hugely gratifying. It's part of our job to step up to support our artists.'' But small and midsize galleries now have to stretch themselves thin to stay in the game. ''It is certainly burdensome for galleries such as myself, who work with younger artists in the career-building stage,'' said the dealer Susan Inglett, who was asked by a museum she would not name for $8,000 to cover shipping on works traveling to a four-person show in the Midwest. But ''I am the first to acknowledge that museum shows certainly help build careers,'' she added, ''which speaks to a conflict of interest and lack of transparency on the part of museums that depend upon such support.'' In a period when galleries and auctions strive to land the highest prices, a museum show can help significantly. Prices rise for works by artists with a museum exhibition approaching. The average selling price of a Mark Grotjahn painting at auction, for example, rose from $322,000 in 2010 to $1.2 million in 2015, according to ArtNet, partly because of exhibitions featuring his work, like ''The Forever Now: Contemporary Painting in an Atemporal World,'' which opened at the Museum of Modern Art in 2014. Some galleries request something tangible in return. ''With a major four- to five-figure contribution, we will ask a museum for certain sponsor benefits such as tickets to their gala, credit in the catalog or seats at the lenders' dinner,'' Ms. Mitchell-Innes said. ''Museums understand that whether funding is coming from a bank, a luxury brand or a gallery, there needs to be some benefit to that sponsor.'' At the Guggenheim Museum, galleries are typically part of what the museum calls a Leadership Committee that includes collectors, foundations and businesses whose ''support goes directly toward the costs of presenting an exhibition,'' Sarah Eaton, a museum spokeswoman, said. Jeremy Strick, director of the Nasher Sculpture Center in Dallas, said his institution was ''most grateful for that support.'' He acknowledged that depending too much on outside funding can compromise a museum's ''curatorial independence.'' But, he said, ''The quality of a museum's program is the ultimate standard by which to judge whether those programs are serving their public purpose.'' The Museum of Modern Art does not seek support from galleries, ''other than periodic contributions to our annual events like galas,'' said Glenn D. Lowry, the director, adding that a gallery will occasionally host a dinner for an artist the museum is showing, ''but not at the museum, and as a gallery event outside the museum.'' But some dealers say museum galas can also be a burden, given that they often include a charity auction to which galleries and their artists are expected to donate artwork. For the Bronx Museum of the Arts' coming gala, for example, the Sean Kelly Gallery -- along with the artists -- contributed two pieces for the auction: a color print by Frank Thiel, which has an estimated retail value of $16,000, and a mixed-media work on paper by Mariko Mori, worth $12,000. The Bryce Wolkowitz Gallery and the artist contributed a José Parlá painting worth $30,000. ''General operating support is the hardest to raise for an institution like the Bronx Museum,'' said Holly Block, the museum's executive director. ''We are dependent on this in a huge way.'' Galleries are also asked to pay fabrication costs for works that have debuts in museum exhibitions and international shows like the Venice Biennale. Ultimately, however, galleries say they feel they have no choice but to play ball, because the potential benefits are mutual. ''We all might grumble here or there or sweat and curse a bit,'' Ms. Boesky said. ''But we do our best to achieve what needs to be achieved.''

Del Tufo, a former New Jersey attorney general and federal prosecutor who offered a lonely dissent in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's corruption investigation known as Abscam, died on Wednesday in Princeton, N.J. He was 82. The cause was lung cancer, his wife, Katherine, said. As United States attorney for New Jersey from 1977 to 1980, Mr. Del Tufo prosecuted a number of high-profile cases against organized crime figures, but was probably best remembered for challenging the federal Abscam investigation. The sting operation, in which politicians were videotaped taking bribes from an Arabian company that was actually a F.B.I. front, resulted in the conviction of six congressmen and Senator Harrison A. Williams, a New Jersey Democrat. Mr. Del Tufo suggested that Mr. Williams had been entrapped by the F.B.I. On tape, the senator first said, ''No, no, no, no,'' when an agent posing as a sheikh offered him a bribe -- a claim Mr. Williams echoed in his unsuccessful appeals. The Justice Department interposed prosecutors from Washington to pursue the case. Upholding the seven convictions, Judge George C. Pratt of Federal District Court in Brooklyn said that few of the defendants would even have been indicted if prosecutors in other jurisdictions had been as ''reluctant to proceed'' as those in New Jersey. Mr. Del Tufo responded that Judge Pratt had ''a warped view of the prosecutor's role in detecting and prosecuting crime.'' He resigned as the federal prosecutor, insisting that his decision was not related to Abscam and that he was not pushed out by the Justice Department. After losing a Democratic primary for governor of New Jersey in 1985, he was appointed attorney general in 1990 by Gov. Jim Florio, a fellow Democrat. Citing the Abscam case, Mr. Florio said, ''It takes a person of principle to stand up, and Bob Del Tufo stood up.'' Serving until January 1994, Mr. Del Tufo was credited with being in the vanguard of prosecuting environmental violations and bias crimes. After leaving public service, he joined the New York law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, retiring in 2014. Robert J. Del Tufo, the son of Italian immigrants, was born in Newark on Nov. 18, 1933, to Raymond and Mary Del Tufo. His father managed a parking garage. His older brother, Raymond Jr., preceded him as the federal prosecutor in New Jersey in the 1950s. He graduated from Princeton in 1955 and from Yale Law School. He was an assistant Morris County prosecutor before being appointed United States attorney during the Carter administration. Besides his wife, Mr. Del Tufo is survived by his daughters, Ann Jackopin and Barbara Del Tufo; his sons, Robert J. Jr. and David; his stepdaughters, Caitlin Hughes and Johanna Hunsbedt; and 10 grandchildren.

But on Monday, in a San Diego courtroom, she will tell a story that has become all too familiar among law students in the United States: Since graduating from the Thomas Jefferson School of Law in 2008, she has yet to find a full-time salaried job as a lawyer. From there, though, her story has taken an unusual twist: Ms. Alaburda, 37, is the first former law student whose case against a law school, charging that it inflated the employment data for its graduates as a way to lure students to enroll, will go to trial. Other disgruntled students have tried to do the same. In the last several years, 15 lawsuits have sought to hold various law schools accountable for publicly listing information critics say was used to pump up alumni job numbers by counting part-time waitress and other similar, full-time jobs as employment. Only one suit besides Ms. Alaburda's remains active. None of the other cases reached trial because judges in Illinois, Michigan and New York, where several cases were filed, generally concluded that law students had opted for legal education at their own peril, and were sophisticated enough to have known that employment as a lawyer was not guaranteed. But a California judge let Ms. Alaburda's suit proceed, brushing aside efforts by the law school to derail her claims. ''It has taken five years,'' said her lawyer, Brian A. Procel of Los Angeles. ''But this will be the first time a law school will be on trial to defend its public employment figures.'' Ms. Alaburda's day in court will take on added meaning: These will be her first public words after years of silence while she pursued a remedy for a legal education gone wrong. She now has student debt of $170,000, with loan interest around 8 percent. Her law degree was not a ticket to a stable, well-paying career, but an expensive detour before she went on to work in a series of part-time positions, mostly temporary jobs reviewing documents for law firms. As her debt mounted and her job prospects faltered, she filed a lawsuit in 2011, arguing that she would not have enrolled at Thomas Jefferson if she had known the law school's statistics were misleading. Thomas Jefferson's average student indebtedness, then about $137,000 -- higher than that at Stanford Law School the same year -- was among the highest in the nation. She also pointed to her school's bar passage rate as consistently lower than 50 percent, which was below the average in California. Thomas Jefferson, like other accused law schools, maintained that it filed only the data that the American Bar Association's accrediting body required. And judges largely agreed. Students would have to be ''wearing blinders'' not to see that a ''goodly number of law school graduates toil (perhaps part time) in drudgery or have less than hugely successful careers,'' Justice Melvin L. Schweitzer of New York Supreme Court wrote in 2012, dismissing a lawsuit by nine former students against New York Law School. The nine had asked for $225 million in damages, on grounds that they had been misled by the school's stated employment figures to believe they had rosier employment prospects than the job market actually offered. The one lawsuit still pending, other than Ms. Alaburda's, accuses Widener University School of Law, in Delaware, of posting employment data that included ''any kind of job, no matter how unrelated to law.'' A Federal District Court judge denied the case class-action status, and that decision is on appeal. Judges in California, which has strong consumer protection laws, have offered more solace to the generation of lawyers who lost out in the legal market, allowing Ms. Alaburda and other plaintiffs there to go forward with claims. However, in two cases -- one against Golden Gate University School of Law and the other against the University of San Francisco School of Law -- judges did not grant law graduates suing the schools class-action certification, which could have led to higher damages awards. The students later dropped their lawsuits. In San Diego, Judge Joel M. Pressman restricted Ms. Alaburda's claims to her own situation. But he ruled against the law school's efforts to get her suit tossed out, on grounds that denying transparent and accurate information to students making decisions about their education can be harmful. Thomas Jefferson, which was fully accredited by the A.B.A. in 2001, says its employment data is accurate and Ms. Alaburda's claims are ''meritless.'' The school has 434 full-time students at its eight-story building in downtown San Diego. Thomas F. Guernsey, the dean, said he could not comment on continuing litigation but noted in a statement that the school had ''a strong track record of producing successful graduates, with 7,000 alumni working nationally and internationally.'' In recent years, the A.B.A., prodded by widespread attention to questionable school data, sagging numbers of law school applicants and skyrocketing law school debt, has revamped its reporting requirements so that law schools must reveal more precise information about their graduates. ''Transparency has substantially increased in the last few years. Students can now easily compare law school outcomes,'' said Brian Z. Tamanaha, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis and the author of ''Failing Law Schools.'' Even so, he noted that ''it's still a little harder for them to determine that the size of the law firm where graduates are employed also reflects the level of income that they can expect.'' Law schools labor to keep their employment data at the highest percentage level because it is a major factor in national law school rankings, which in turn give schools the credibility to charge six figures for a three-year legal education. Fudging the numbers, as Mr. Procel plans to argue in the case against Thomas Jefferson, entices students to choose an education that can result in lifelong debt that cannot be easily discharged even in bankruptcy. Even as legal hiring dropped in 2011, according to Mr. Procel, Thomas Jefferson stated that 92.1 percent of its graduates were working at full-time jobs. That was a major increase from the 83 percent graduate employment the school claimed during the prosperous years of 2006 and 2007. But even in 2006, according to testimony expected at trial, a former school employee says she was pressured into inflating graduate employment data. Thomas Jefferson's lawyers will argue that Ms. Alaburda never incurred any actual injury, because she was offered -- and turned down -- a law firm job with a $60,000 salary shortly after she graduated. Ms. Alaburda said, in legal papers, that she received ''only one job offer -- one which was less favorable than non-law-related jobs that were available'' -- after she sent her résumé to more than 150 law firms and practicing lawyers. She is asking $125,000 in damages.  URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/business/dealbook/court-to-hear-suit-accusing- law-school-of-inflating-job-data.html"

Yes, gusts of wind and snow softly brushing up against the windows. But no dump trucks thundering off building canyons. No bleeping from delivery vans as they backed up. Not one siren. Here and there the muffled rumple of snowplows trying their best. Like a spy, the quiet followed us all day. We made it to the Whitney; Gansevoort Street was like an abandoned set of a long-forgotten film. Inside the museum we were practically alone. On an upper floor we looked out through 30-foot windows as a raging gray and white painting silently formed, collapsed and formed anew. Behind us in the cool-white vault of museum space, Frank Stella's enormous, colorful sculptures screamed ''Look at us!'' without saying a word. The quiet continued into the night and the next day. Our apartment began to feel like a log cabin, tucked in the folds of a mountain pass, with nothing to be heard near or far. Even the day after that, on a sunny walk to the top of a snow-covered Central Park Reservoir, we were surrounded by stillness as we looked south to the silhouette of the city -- a shadow of its noisy self. Now, I love the sounds of New York. The thriving hum of humanity striving. Buildings that bark and flirt for attention. The constant whispering of history everywhere. But oh, when the city falls silent, New York sings.

Rosalie Calabrese Dear Diary: I served as an arborist with a tree-service crew doing a job in Fresh Meadows, Queens. We were pruning in early February in the residential streets around Jewel Avenue; a water main will be renovated there and the heavy equipment will wreak havoc on overhanging branches. Bob, a pruner, and I proceed block by block, inspecting the trees that need a haircut. From the ground, he takes in the whole shape of the tree. Then he hops in the bucket, zooms into the face of the canopy, grabs one or two of the branches to get them out of his face -- and, it seems, just to get the feel of them. Then he revs up his chain saw and goes to work. Despite the concrete, the asphalt and all the brick houses lining the street, I have a sense that we are making our way through a deep forest. The diversity of species is astonishing. The common ginkgo is uncommon here. There are massive pin oaks and diminutive, delicate plums, many red maples, heavy sycamores still holding aloft their pompom seed pods. Here there are cherries, sweet gums, London planes, lindens, zelkovas, crab apples. A few bald cypresses and eastern redbuds. A swamp white oak. In New York City? It's a veritable garden of specimens, an arboretum to rival the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. When Bob comes back to earth he is smiling, all thumbs up. It must look different from the height of a bucket. I'm going to go up there someday.

When my mother died in 2001, my sister and I had to sell the Upper West Side co-op apartment in which we grew up and in which my parents had lived since 1942. They had done almost no work on the place since about 1950, as far as I can recall. My sister, being the one who lives in New York City, went to the closing of the sale. All was going well when, as she reported, she told the buyer that there was ''one more little stipulation'' that she wanted to put in. His face fell. She said that she and her sister would love to see the apartment when it had been renovated. He kindly agreed, and a few years later when I was visiting New York, we called and he invited us over. It was lovely. They had been creative about making it a much nicer space, but they had kept all the (many) built-in bookshelves, which we loved and which, they said, had sold them on the apartment originally.

In Cincinnati, a woman died in January after she and her husband overdosed in their baby's room at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. The husband was found unconscious with a gun in his pocket, a syringe in his arm and needles strewn around the sink. Here in Cambridge a few years ago, after several people overdosed in the bathrooms of a historic church, church officials reluctantly closed the bathrooms to the public. ''We weren't medically equipped or educated to handle overdoses, and we were desperately afraid we were going to have something happen that was way out of our reach,'' said the Rev. Joseph O. Robinson, rector of the church, Christ Church Cambridge. With heroin cheap and widely available on city streets throughout the country, users are making their buys and shooting up as soon as they can, often in public places. Police officers are routinely finding drug users -- unconscious or dead -- in cars, in the bathrooms of fast-food restaurants, on mass transit and in parks, hospitals and libraries. The visibility of drug users may be partly attributed to the nature of the epidemic, which has grown largely out of dependence on legal opioid painkillers and has spread to white, urban, suburban and rural areas. Nationally, 125 people a day die from drug overdoses, 78 of them from heroin and painkillers, and many more are revived, brought back from the brink of death -- often in full public view. The police in Upper Darby, Pa., have even posted a video of another man shooting heroin on a public bus, and then being revived by Narcan, which reverses the effects of a heroin overdose, to demonstrate the drug's effectiveness. Some addicts even seek out towns where emergency medical workers carry Narcan, ''knowing if they do overdose, there's a good likelihood that when police respond, they'll be able to administer Narcan,'' said Special Agent Timothy Desmond, a spokesman for the New England region of the Drug Enforcement Administration. In Linthicum, Md., Brian Knighton, a wrestler known as Axl Rotten in Extreme Championship Wrestling, died last month after overdosing in a McDonald's bathroom. In Cincinnati in 2014, an Indiana couple overdosed on heroin at a McDonald's, collapsing in front of their children in the restaurant's play area. In Niagara Falls, N.Y., a man was accused in October of leaving a 5-year-old boy unattended in a Dairy Queen while he went to the bathroom; he was later found on the floor with a syringe in his arm. In Johnstown, Pa., a man overdosed on heroin on Feb. 19 in a bathroom at the Cambria County Library. ''Users need the fix as quickly as they can get it,'' said Edward James Walsh, chief of police in Taunton, Mass., a city 40 miles south of here that has been plagued with heroin overdoses in recent years. ''The physical and psychological need is so great for an addict that they will use it at the earliest opportunity.'' That reality has taxed law enforcement and city services across the country, and has stretched the tolerance of businesses that allow unfettered access to their bathrooms. Legal liability is an increasing worry. ''Overdosing has become an issue of great societal concern,'' said Martin W. Healy, chief legal counsel for the Massachusetts Bar Association. ''I'm not aware of any seminal cases so far, but this is likely to be a developing area of the law.'' After shooting up in public places, people often leave behind dirty needles, posing a health hazard. In response, some groups have called for supervised injection facilities, like those in Canada and Europe, where people can inject themselves under medical supervision. The goal is to keep them from overdosing and to curb infectious diseases. Such facilities are illegal in this country, although the mayor of Ithaca, N.Y., recently suggested opening one. In Boston, where pedestrians step over drug users who are nodding off on a stretch of Massachusetts Avenue known as Methadone Mile, an organization for the homeless has planned what it calls a safe space, where users could ride out their high under supervision; it would not allow actual injection on site. New England has been a cradle of the heroin epidemic. Middlesex County, which encompasses Cambridge, a city of 107,000 just west of Boston, has the highest number of overdose deaths from heroin and prescription pain pills in Massachusetts. From 2000 to 2014, Middlesex, which also includes the city of Lowell, a major heroin hotbed, had 1,634 opioid deaths. No one keeps track of how many deaths occur in public spaces, but law enforcement officials agree the number is high. ''We quite frequently see folks using public areas,'' said Robert C. Haas, the Cambridge police commissioner. It was the fear of someone dying in their bathrooms that led officials at Christ Church Cambridge to close public access to them in 2012. By doing so, the church did not experience the kind of tragic scenes that are occurring around the country, but the decision was difficult. The church, which opened in 1761 and has a long history of social activism, had kept the bathrooms open to accommodate the homeless people around Harvard Square. But addicts were also using them. Closing them after decades of serving the public represented ''a retreat from our ministry,'' Mr. Robinson said. But in consultation with the Cambridge police, the church reluctantly concluded that leaving the bathrooms open only enabled drug users. Because there were no free-standing public toilets in Harvard Square, a popular shopping, culture and dining destination that is visited by eight million tourists a year, the absence of the church bathrooms was felt right away. ''Almost immediately, we began receiving calls saying, basically, 'What the hell just happened?' '' said Denise Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association. ''They were saying, 'Our doorways and alleyways have become public urinals, and people are defecating everywhere.' '' After a campaign by business owners and local activists for a public toilet -- which included stickers that read ''I Love Toilets'' and ''Where Would Jesus Go?'' -- the City of Cambridge spent $400,000 to buy and install Harvard Square's first free-standing public toilet. It was unveiled on Feb. 12. Free to use and open 24 hours a day, it sits in a kiosk on a busy traffic island between the stately brick buildings of Harvard Yard and the weathered headstones in the Old Burying Ground, which dates to 1635. The kiosk, called the Portland Loo and made in Oregon, was designed specifically to discourage drug use. It has slanted slats at the bottom that allow the police -- or anyone -- to peer in and see if someone has passed out on the concrete floor. It has no heat, air conditioning or noise insulation, all meant to foil anyone from getting too comfortable inside. The hand-washing faucet is outside, and an attendant cleans four times a day. The outcome pleased Mr. Robinson, who said the anguishing decision to close the church bathrooms had ''led to a broader response to the needs of the homeless in our neighborhood.''

There was no great anxiety about it beforehand, but it was still noteworthy that Tanaka made it safely through two innings of his spring training debut against the Philadelphia Phillies without any physical limitations. That leaves him on pace to start on opening day for the Yankees. ''That is the goal,'' he said through an interpreter. ''That is what I am trying to do.'' Shortly after that Oct. 6 playoff loss to the Astros, Tanaka had surgery to remove a bone spur in his right elbow. The spur did not cause Tanaka to miss any starts. He said it had not bothered him on days he pitched, only between starts. But for a second straight season, Tanaka had to pitch around arm injuries. A wrist and forearm strain caused him to miss all of May, and he made only 24 starts. The previous season, his rookie campaign, Tanaka was found to have a small tear in his ulnar collateral ligament, and he made just 20 starts. The hope, of course, is that he will not only survive the entire coming season free of injuries but also pitch to the level he did in the first half of 2014, before the first elbow injury surfaced. ''Yes, I do feel that I can get back to that form,'' he said after his outing against the Phillies, ''because it feels better.'' Pitching to catcher Gary Sanchez, Tanaka threw two scoreless innings. He allowed two hits and a walk and struck out two batters. Most important, he reported no problems with his elbow, either during the game, a 6-5 Phillies win, or at any point during spring training. Manager Joe Girardi said Tanaka was on schedule to start opening day against the Astros, in what is likely to be a rematch of the wild-card face-off between Tanaka and Dallas Keuchel. ''The idea is that he is our No. 1 starter,'' Girardi said, ''but you have to see how he does physically.'' Tanaka was assisted in the game by Rob Refsnyder, who made his debut of sorts at third base. With runners on first and second and nobody out in the first inning, Refsnyder dived to his left to snare a sharp ground ball off the bat of Carlos Ruiz. He scrambled to his feet and fired a strike to Starlin Castro, who relayed to Dustin Ackley to complete the double play. ''He got the good part of the bat, and the ball had a lot of velocity,'' Tanaka said of the ball Ruiz hit. ''It was huge that he made that play.'' In his brief professional career, Refsnyder has been moved from right field to second base, where Castro is set to be the starter. Now Refsnyder is being asked to try third base. If he can show proficiency there, he stands a chance of making the roster as a backup infielder. Refsnyder began working at third base about a week ago and said he had split his time evenly between second and third in practices. ''I'm just trying to do my best and help the team in any way I can,'' he said. Refsnyder also performed well offensively, with a hit and a walk in two plate appearances. He stole two bases and scored a run. Sanchez, another young player given a chance to start, did well behind the plate. He left the game in the sixth inning after being hit in the leg by a pitch by the submarine thrower Greg Burke, but he said he felt fine. Austin Romine, who is also competing for the backup catching job, replaced Sanchez and went 2 for 2 with two doubles and three R.B.I. Sanchez, 23, who is from the Dominican Republic, is one of the top prospects in the Yankees organization. He is competing for a spot as the backup to Brian McCann and is considered the catcher of the future. The Yankees must weigh the benefits of having him sit and learn behind McCann against giving him a chance to play every day in Class AAA. ''I'm excited to be in the mix,'' Sanchez said through an interpreter. ''But for us players who want to make it to the big leagues, it is not our decision.'' As for catching Tanaka, Sanchez said he was pleased with how the two innings had proceeded. ''We were on the same page,'' he said.

He was 95. His death was confirmed by his daughter Kathryn Wistert. Wistert was often outweighed by the man across the line of scrimmage in his nine N.F.L. seasons, all with the Eagles. But he was not known as Ox for nothing. He mowed down opponents on both offense and defense and covered punts and kickoffs as well. He was named a first-team All-Pro six times by major national news agencies and was considered one of the finest players to miss out on election to the Pro Football Hall in Canton, Ohio. Al Wistert and his brothers Francis, known as Whitey, and Alvin were all-American tackles at the University of Michigan, which has retired the No. 11 worn by each of them. Al was a modest 6 feet 1 inches and weighed about 215 pounds, but his blocks sprang the Eagles' future Hall of Fame running back Steve Van Buren on long gains, and he was tenacious and mobile on defense. Wistert's Eagles, coached by Earle Neale, known as Greasy, went to three straight N.F.L. championship games. They were beaten by the Chicago Cardinals, 28-21, in 1947 at Comiskey Park, then defeated the Cardinals, 7-0, in a snowstorm at Philadelphia's Shibe Park the following year and repeated as champions with a 14-0 triumph over the Rams on a muddy Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum field. The 1948 and '49 Eagles teams are the only N.F.L. squads to have won consecutive league championships by shutouts. ''We wanted to get those shutouts because whenever we shut out an opponent, we'd get a free dinner at Old Bookbinder's,'' Wistert told The Bucks County Courier Times in 2008, referring to the Philadelphia seafood restaurant Old Original Bookbinder's. In a 1993 letter to the board of selectors of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, George Savitsky, an Eagles tackle on their 1948 and '49 championship teams after an all-American career at Penn, wrote, as related in Ray Didinger and Robert S. Lyons's ''The Eagles Encyclopedia'' (2005), that Wistert ''should have been inducted many years ago.'' ''How could he be overlooked?'' Savitsky wondered. The Hall of Fame coach George Allen rated Wistert one of the top 10 defensive linemen in ''Pro Football's 100 Greatest Players'' (1982). Albert Alexander Wistert was born on Dec. 28, 1920, in Chicago, a son of Lithuanian immigrants. When he was young, his father, Kazimer, a Chicago police sergeant, died of complications of wounds sustained when he was shot during a holdup. Al's brother Francis played tackle on two unbeaten Michigan teams in the early 1930s. Al starred at Michigan from 1940 to 1942. His brother Alvin made his Michigan debut at age 31 after service with the Marines in World War II and played for undefeated Wolverine teams in 1947 and '48. Al Wistert, the only Wistert brother to play in the N.F.L., was selected by the Eagles in the fifth round of the 1943 draft, but spent his rookie season with a hybrid team known as the Steagles, essentially an Eagles team with some players from the Pittsburgh Steelers, both having lost many athletes to military service. Deferred from the World War II military because of a bone ailment, Al Wistert developed an innovative form of blocking, ramming a defender with his shoulder, then heading downfield looking for another victim to level instead of being satisfied, like most linemen, with one cross block that would leave him on the ground as the play went on. The Eagles retired Wistert's No. 70 in 1952, the first time they had accorded that honor to a former player. Wistert left pro football after the 1951 season. He later coached high school football in New Jersey and sold insurance before retiring in Oregon. In addition to his daughter Kathryn, he is survived by his daughters Pamela Avila and Dianna Rorabacher, three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. His wife, Ellie, died in 2004. When the Eagles defeated the Rams in the 1949 N.F.L. championship game, the team's management threw a victory banquet at the Bel-Air Country Club in Los Angeles. But the players' rewards did not include championship rings. As Wistert told it in Gordon Forbes's ''Tales From the Eagles Sidelines'' (2002): ''They gave us these Zippo cigarette lighters. They didn't even have our names on them or anything else about the championship. I left mine at the table.''

14,The New York Times,7-Mar-16,Baseball? Yes. Seeing Fidel? No. U.S. and Cuba Negotiate Obama's Visit.,Late Edition - Final,,"HAVANA, CUBA (90%)",By JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS,ENGLISH,,,CUBA (99%); UNITED STATES (99%),Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; WHITE HOUSE LETTER; Pg. 4,,Newspaper,,BARACK OBAMA (91%); RAUL CASTRO (79%); FIDEL CASTRO (79%),1103 words,,7-Mar-16,,MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL (84%); COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY (54%),,SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS (90%); US PRESIDENTS (90%); BASEBALL (90%); TALKS & MEETINGS (78%); AGREEMENTS (78%); HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (71%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (71%); FOREIGN POLICY (70%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (69%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (67%); US NAVY (65%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (64%); NAVIES (60%); EMBARGOES & SANCTIONS (53%),"WASHINGTON --  When Major League Baseball completed a deal with the Cuban government last week to hold an exhibition game in Havana during President Obama's planned visit this month, White House officials quietly rejoiced that a pivotal piece of their plan had fallen into place after weeks of intensive negotiations. It was just one aspect of an elaborate behind-the-scenes effort by American and Cuban officials to ensure that Mr. Obama's historic visit to Cuba yields the powerful symbolism and concrete policy progress they are seeking. Both sides have a lot at stake. A successful trip could vindicate the decision by Mr. Obama and President Raúl Castro of Cuba to pursue an official thaw, broadcasting to both of their publics the possibilities of a new relationship and building political support in the United States for ending a decades-old trade embargo. But a misstep or public dispute has the potential to set back that goal by highlighting the deep differences that remain between the United States and Cuba. There is also the risk of dissonance in trying to open a new chapter in relations when so many of the old plotlines, including differences over human rights violations by Mr. Castro's government, are still playing out. ''This trip can either be the vindication or the refutation of Obama's approach in Cuba,'' said Christopher Sabatini, a professor of international affairs at Columbia University and the director of the Brooklyn-based research organization Global Americans. ''If the Cubans lecture him on human rights or crack down on dissidents while he is there, it's going to be quite ugly,'' Professor Sabatini said. ''It would make the president look like a dupe, and it would be a huge indictment of his foreign policy.'' Officials on both sides are holding exhaustive talks to avoid such a public rift and instead showcase points of agreement and cooperation. They are haggling over everything from the details of the baseball game to which regulatory changes and business deals can be announced during the visit. A presidential baseball outing is now in, but a visit to the United States naval base at Guantánamo Bay is out. A speech by Mr. Obama to the Cuban people and a meeting with their president are planned, and a visit with political dissidents is a nonnegotiable demand, the White House told the Cubans. An appearance with Fidel Castro, the president's older brother and the father of the Communist revolution, is to be avoided at all costs. Adding to the complexity and urgency of the task, there is no modern template for a sitting American president to visit Cuba, because it was nearly 90 years ago -- when Calvin Coolidge arrived on a battleship -- that the last one did. ''This is new for everybody,'' said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, who has lured at least one former lieutenant temporarily back to the National Security Council to help. ''There may be irritants, there may be potholes, but people in both countries want this to happen.'' Arranging a meeting with antigovernment activists has already emerged as a point of contention. Amid resistance from the Cubans, Secretary of State John Kerry was forced to scrap tentative plans to travel to Havana on Friday to meet with a group of dissidents. White House officials made it clear to their Cuban counterparts early on that such a meeting was mandatory for the president, but they have disagreed over whom Mr. Obama should see. ''The Cubans are always resistant, but we laid down at the beginning of discussions he will meet with dissidents,'' Mr. Rhodes said. He is negotiating over the trip with the same group of Cuban officials he secretly met with for months in Canada to strike the initial 2014 deal to begin normalizing relations. The Cuban government has made no secret of its displeasure about Mr. Obama's plans to see the dissidents. Just after the White House announced the trip last month, Josefina Vidal, a senior Cuban Foreign Ministry official, said her country and the United States held ''different ideas'' about human rights. She said she hoped Mr. Obama would have a chance to speak with ''real Cuban civil society,'' apparently alluding to her government's opinion that the dissidents American officials have sought to support are not legitimate. There is less disagreement on travel and commerce between the United States and Cuba, and officials are discussing changes and business deals that the two sides could announce during the trip to tighten their ties. The White House is also considering revising regulations to allow American dollars to be used in transactions with Cuba and to allow individual Americans to travel there for ''people-to-people'' visits currently permitted only as part of group tours, Mr. Rhodes said. Talks on the trip have been unfolding for months, after the two presidents first discussed it during a September meeting in New York at the United Nations General Assembly, their second meeting after announcing the policy shift in December 2014. Mr. Obama told Mr. Castro that he would like to visit Cuba before the end of his term, but that he would be willing to make the trip only if he could justify it by pointing to concrete progress in the normalization process. He instructed senior White House aides to begin working toward that goal. Mr. Rhodes enlisted Bernadette Meehan, a former National Security Council spokeswoman and Foreign Service officer, who left the White House in June, to return to the West Wing to help plan the trip, reflecting the complexity of the task and the importance Mr. Obama places on bringing it off smoothly. For the Americans planning the trip, there have been some pleasant surprises -- their government-issued BlackBerries work in Havana! -- and some obstacles. The dearth of hotel rooms in Havana has made it extremely difficult to find enough beds for all the aides, security personnel, reporters, businesspeople and others who are clamoring to be part of the visit. A huge amount of preparatory work is being done by a lean United States Embassy staff in Havana, kept small by congressional restrictions imposed by opponents of Mr. Obama's policy shift. ''Every presidential trip has extraordinary detail at every level, from security to politics to media coverage, but Cuba's not every trip,'' said Peter Kornbluh, a co-author of ''Back Channel to Cuba,'' which recounts decades of clandestine talks between the American and Cuban governments. ''This is a singularly historic game-changer that will be remembered like Nixon's trip to China, and both sides have a lot at stake.''

A culmination of the Somewhere Project, a citywide exploration of that classic 1957 musical that began in January, the production mixed professional actors with 15 high-school-aged apprentices in the cast, supplemented by a whopping chorus of 200 high school singers from 26 schools representing all five boroughs. Conducting the lush 40-piece orchestra was the eminent Marin Alsop, music director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, who was once a protégée of Leonard Bernstein, the composer of ''West Side Story,'' of course. The site was fitting for this nontraditional but nevertheless faithful production, which essentially dispensed with sets and featured simple, contemporary costumes by Tracy Christensen. The show was performed on a long, rectangular stage made to resemble a strip of roadway -- a drag strip, you might say -- with the audience seated on three sides, some at tables and some in bleacherlike seating. Festive strings of lights hung above the stage, but it took me a while to even notice, since so much blazing radiance was coming at me from the young performers. The dancing, in particular, was so thrillingly ecstatic that I wouldn't have been surprised if one of the high-flying Jets or Sharks took an errant leap and landed on one of those stage-side tables. Conceived by and directed with a fresh eye by Amanda Dehnert, this production had an informal feeling, with the actors announcing the scenes, settings and times of the action. But this smattering of meta-theatricality didn't detract from the show's dramatic impact. Nor did the colorblind casting. The Jets weren't all white, the Sharks weren't all Puerto Rican, and it didn't matter a bit. They were easily identified by the color of their varied running shoes: red for the Jets, lavender for the Sharks. (It was, I'll admit, a little disconcerting to see a man bun on one of the Jets, who we associate with crisp 1950s cuts.) Skylar Astin, seen onstage in ''Spring Awakening'' and on film in the ''Pitch Perfect'' movies, made for a forcefully moving Tony, with a powerful voice and a palpable ardor for his Maria, played with blooming innocence by Morgan Hernandez, one of the non-Equity members in the cast, a freshman studying musical theater at the Boston Conservatory. As Maria's brother, Bernardo, leader of the Sharks, Donald Jones Jr. was a virile presence, his love for his sister flaring into menace when he learned of her clandestine romance. Manny Stark brought a cocky edginess to Riff, leader of the Jets. And Bianca Marroquín was a sultry Anita, whose near-rape sets in motion the events that bring the musical to its tragic climax. Supplementing the young performers, in sterling fashion, were the stage veterans Chuck Cooper, as both Doc and Officer Krupke, and Peter Gerety as Schrank, along with Stanley Bahorek as Glad Hand. This production retained much of Jerome Robbins's celebrated choreography, with interpolations or adjustments made by Sean Cheesman in certain numbers, in some cases to accommodate the unusual shape of the stage and the placement of the audience. Mr. Cheesman also created new choreography for the high-energy ''Dance at the Gym'' number. I felt jarred only during the ''Somewhere'' ballet sequence, when the transition between Mr. Robbins's classically based steps and Mr. Cheesman's less formal, contemporary style became apparent. In any case, the dancing was breathtaking in its exuberance: Here was the raw energy of youth channeled into formal patterns that nevertheless captured perfectly the characters' emotional intensity and abandon. I sat at the far end of the stage, the furthest distance from the orchestra, and there were moments when the balance between (amplified) voices and (amplified) musicians wasn't perfect. But to hear this rapturous score played by an orchestra of such size, under the guidance of a first-rate conductor, was a pure pleasure in itself. For ''One Hand, One Heart'' and ''Somewhere,'' the cast members were joined by that supersized youth chorus, mostly surrounding the stage and looking on at the action, holding small candles. The sound of so many voices added a layer of emotional plushness to the songs that was goose-pimple-inducing, and utterly irresistible. So, really, was the entire production, which may have been conceived in part as a public-spirited educational project, but ultimately became a simple yet transporting production of a great musical.

Ms. Vestager, the European Union's competition commissioner, is expected to move ahead in the coming months in the antitrust case she filed against Google, in which she has accused the company of favoring some of its own services in search results over those of rivals. The current charges, listed in what is known as a statement of objections, are just one in a number of competition-related headaches that the search engine may face this year in Europe. Ms. Vestager is also investigating whether Apple received an unfair tax deal from Ireland, and Amazon from Luxembourg, that broke Europe's state aid rules. Her aggressive positions have made the 47-year-old Danish politician -- said to be among the inspirations behind ''Borgen,'' a critically acclaimed TV show described as Denmark's answer to ''The West Wing'' -- a poster child for Europe's somewhat combative relationship with United States tech giants. Ms. Vestager sat down with The New York Times last week to discuss her priorities for the year, the issues underpinning her competition investigations and whether she unfairly targets American companies. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. â-  What are your plans for 2016? What's obvious is that it's not just important to open cases, but important to close cases, too. But as some of the antitrust cases we have ongoing are huge, that's not necessarily going to happen in 2016. I expect in the merger field we will keep busy, and we'll keep our focus on antitrust and state aid issues. â-  The first anniversary of the statement of objections in the Google case is fast approaching. Have your thoughts changed on the issues at play? Since we aren't done yet, we can't yet go through the different elements of the statement of objections. But Google gave us a very substantial answer, and what we need to do is ask them for more data to have a comprehensive picture so they aren't just giving us data that solely substantiates their position. It's a huge task. We're doing our best with the analysis, but it's also interesting to see how legitimate third parties [that have filed complaints in the case] also look at it. â-  Are you disappointed you haven't moved the case forward? I have learned that to do antitrust at this volume takes the patience of steel. Speed is itself a quality because we have big companies whose names are being mentioned over and over again, so you have to think about that. But speed isn't a quality unto itself. You can't substitute justice with speed. You need to be able to say this will hold up in court. Then, speed is a secondary issue. â-  The current charges against Google are just one of many antitrust issues you're looking into at the company, including its role in advertising, as well as Android, its mobile operating system. Do you see a common thread? That depends. Other complaints related to online mapping or local search are similar, as they say Google uses its position to promote itself in neighboring markets. That is very similar to the current statement of objections. Then we have issues that are different in nature. One is scraping [allegations that Google copies content from other sites]; another is the question of advertising [claims that Google abuses its dominance in advertising contracts]; and then we have Android, which is almost another planet. We will become much wiser as we go in-depth in these areas. â-  Germany's competition authority has opened an investigation into Facebook and its use of people's data. Do you think access to digital data will become a competition issue? It's not black or white. The questions people have been asking are whether data can be duplicated, and can a competitor establish itself in the same way or buy a copy of another's data? So far, the analysis shows that data can be copied or newly created without any detrimental effects to competitors. That's why I have approached this area with a very open mind. â-  So there isn't a competition problem because many companies have access to people's data? That doesn't necessarily have to be a problem. But I still think Adam Smith was right when he said there's no such thing as a free lunch. Eventually, you will pay in one form or the other. And it's that ''other'' that is still hard to grasp because we are just in the process of truly appreciating the value of our own data. â-  You're Europe's competition, not tax, authority. So why are you getting involved in tax cases linked to potential abuse of state aid? National tax legislation and European state aid rules need to be fulfilled at the same time. For me, it's a simple question of fair competition. Companies compete door to door with similar products, prices and services. If one company has higher costs and another company has lower costs solely because of aggressive tax arrangements, then you have a problem. â-  For many American companies, particularly in the tech sector, there's a sense that Europe is targeting them. What's your response to that? There's a lot of convenience in that argument. I've been asking my people to give me the statistics to find a bias, and I can find no bias. Not in the mergers, not in the fines being paid out, there's no U.S. bias. It also ignores the fact that we often react to complaints from U.S. companies. These are huge companies that play a very strong role in the market. But you still have many, many, many more companies that are on their way, that want to make it into the market, and that need open markets for the incentive to innovate.

LUCIE, Fla. --  The Los Angeles Dodgers' Chase Utley, who was barred for two games after his aggressive slide in a playoff game last year broke the leg of Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada, had his suspension lifted by Major League Baseball, according to multiple news media reports. The Los Angeles Times first reported Sunday that baseball and the players' union had reached an agreement lifting Utley's suspension. Tony Clark, the union's executive director, who was visiting the Mets' spring training complex here on Sunday, said the matter had been ''resolved,'' but he declined to comment further. In a pivotal play during Game 2 of a National League division series, Utley slid hard into Tejada to break up a double play. Tejada's injury caused him to miss the rest of the postseason. Utley was called safe on the play, but Joe Torre, Major League Baseball's chief baseball officer and its disciplinarian, ruled the slide illegal and suspended Utley for two games. Utley appealed, allowing him to continue playing during the postseason, but baseball and the union took up the case in the off-season, leading to a rule change addressing so-called rolling slides. Tejada told reporters before a spring training game against the Atlanta Braves on Sunday that he had moved on from the episode. ''I don't care, really,'' he said. ''I care about me. I'm healthy here. I'm happy here. I don't care about what's going to happen there. That's the past. I'm all right here this year, healthy.'' Under baseball's new policy, a slide breaking up a double play will have to include a bona fide attempt to reach and remain on base. Contact with the fielder is allowed, but the runner cannot change his path to initiate contact or engage in a ''roll block.'' The plays will be subject to video review, and if it is determined that the runner did not engage in a bona fide slide attempt, interference will be called, and both the runner and the batter can be called out. ''The most important thing is that the rule was changed, as far as I'm concerned,'' Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson said. Alderson also suggested that the league should drop the suspension of Mets pitcher Hansel Robles, who threw toward the head of Phillies catcher Cameron Rupp in an October game. Baseball and Robles last month negotiated a reduced penalty of a two-game ban, instead of three. ''As long as they are dropping penalties, they might as well drop his,'' Alderson said.

This Oscar winner for best documentary short, directed by Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy (''Saving Face''), recounts the story of Ms. Qaiser, a survivor in a year when more than 700 women in Pakistan were killed by their families.

In Pakistan, throwing acid on women to disfigure them is an alarmingly common form of revenge, often for rejected sexual advances or marriage proposals.

It was Sunday morning in Tripoli's old city, but only a trickle of worshipers was expected at the 19th-century Anglican church, which towered over the curling alleyways. The congregation is made up mostly of African migrants, said Oke, the watchman. But now they stay away, fearing arrest by the predatory militias that prowl the streets of the capital. So the migrants lie low, waiting for the calm seas of summer and the chance of a boat to Europe. Oke is waiting, too -- headed to London, he said, insisting somewhat improbably that he intended to apply for a visa. ''I'll make it this year,'' he said. ''Or maybe next. I hope.'' Everyone seems to be waiting for something in Tripoli, a tense and listless city caught in the maw of Libya's strange war. As conflict rages elsewhere in the country -- in the ravaged eastern city of Benghazi, or Surt, where the Islamic State exerts its brutal grip -- a precarious order holds in the capital. Smugglers lurk in the port; migrants lie in wait; heavily armed militias and squabbling politicians, nominally allied, quietly vie for control. For all that, Tripoli has a veneer of calm and sophistication, even prosperity, that is at odds with the image of a war-torn nation. A smooth, six-lane highway swoops across its suburbs. Rush-hour traffic is ferocious because of lavish subsidies that make fuel cheaper than bottled water. (A sedan's tank can be filled for about $2.) In a cobblestone plaza, under an Ottoman clock tower, men lounge in the sun with the paraphernalia of cafe culture: croissants, cellphones, cigarettes and paper cups of nus-nus, a silky coffee drink with a dash of milk and cream. In the best shopping areas, near the old Italian buildings, there are gyms and pizza parlors and gleaming outlets for European fashion brands. Not many war zones can boast Benetton or Marks & Spencer or, as Tripoli does, a well-stocked Boss outlet. After nightfall, on the seafront, children play soccer under the palm trees while their fathers puff on water pipes and hunch over small glowing boxes -- portable Wi-Fi hot spots -- that offer an Internet fix. Up close, though, the picture becomes more troubling. The snazzy stores are largely empty because few can afford to shop there. Libya's petro-wealth, which underwrote Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's eccentric 42-year rule, is sputtering dry: Oil production has slumped, the currency is crashing, and the Central Bank's cash reserves are running perilously low. Security is brittle. The smartly uniformed men who loiter at busy traffic junctions belong to Tripoli's myriad militias: Islamists, fighters from the nearby city of Misurata or just neighborhood gunmen. Robbery, kidnapping and human rights abuses are rife; random bursts of gunfire erupt in neighborhoods at night. A wedding? Or gunfight? Nobody seems sure, and nobody wants to ask. Odd things happen. One night, a senior government official agreed to meet in a hotel lobby. But when I turned up, with a colleague, he admonished us loudly with theatrical flair. ''I never agreed to meet you!'' he protested in the lobby. Only 20 minutes earlier, the man had given us directions to the hotel over the phone. His outburst had the air of a performance, perhaps for the benefit of someone else. We left quietly. Then again, Westerners are rare: Even the die-hards of any trouble spot -- the United Nations, embassies and aid agencies -- evacuated to Tunisia almost two years ago. The handful of foreigners who remain are viewed as spies by suspicious Libyans, or as bait for the city's many hostage-takers. ''It's become like America, a land of opportunity -- for kidnappers,'' said Mohanned el Mahjoub, a chatty 30-year-old militia commander, as we sped through Tripoli one night in his hulking four-wheel-drive Jeep. He had a friendly yet nervy air, chain-smoking and rattling off his thoughts; the amber streetlights illuminated his scarred face. The Jeep halted at a check post on the southern city limits -- a concrete hut on the edge of a field -- where Mr. Mahjoub pulled up a plastic chair and explained why he had brokered a local cease-fire with a rival group. ''Once we sat down with them,'' he said, ''we realized we were fighting for the same thing.'' Other Libyans also have to remind themselves why they are quarreling. At first glance, their war is a maddening stew of towns, tribes and armed groups driven by as many motivations: money, oil, religion and the manipulations of countries, like Egypt and Turkey, that support rival sides. At its core, though, the conflict often seems to boil down to human factors: personality, grudges and greed. As it drags on, some are questioning its cost. Mr. Mahjoub pointed to the glass right eye that replaced the real one he lost to a mortar shell splinter in the fight to oust Colonel Qaddafi in 2011. Before the revolution, he dreamed of becoming a commercial airline pilot and made plans to move to Canada. ''I never made it,'' he said with a wry smile. Billions of dollars in half-finished construction projects ribbon the city skyline: concrete skeletons of hotels, shopping malls and apartment blocks, swaddled in scaffolding and motionless cranes. Work on most stopped in 2011, including a golden mosque commissioned by Colonel Qaddafi's second wife, Safia, who lives in exile in Oman. Even less remains of Colonel Qaddafi himself. His Bab al-Aziziya compound has been bulldozed into a giant rubbish dump. The only sight of his visage is on a satellite television station funded by his exiled supporters. But the central question raised by his ouster looms more urgently than ever. Can a country long unified by oil wealth now find a better reason to stay together? Time is running out to find an answer. The country's cash reserves, the glittering prize for Libya's many warring factions, are being sucked dry by a thriving black market. Fishermen have converted their trawlers into covert tankers that smuggle cheap Libyan fuel to Tunisia and Malta, causing the price of fish to soar. Cheap Libyan flour can be found as far afield as Mali. And under the arches of the old souk, beside the gold jewelers and cloth merchants, men in sneakers and sunglasses trade bricks of cash -- hundreds of thousands of dollars and euros -- as the public face of the flourishing currency market, a source of elaborate scams and fabulous wealth. A Libyan banker, who agreed to meet for brunch in a cafe overlooking the sea, explained: Well-connected businessmen and militia commanders buy dollars from the Libyan Central Bank at the official rate, either with credit cards used to withdraw the money in Turkey (over 500,000 such cards have been issued, he said) or through fake import schemes in which empty tankers have pulled into port. Returning to Libya, they sell the dollars back onto the black market, tripling their money. ''Easy money,'' the banker said, ''and it's made a handful of people very, very rich.'' Of late, the gears of war have been shifting in Libya, and few believe that Tripoli's delicate status quo can hold. Gen. Khalifa Hifter, a brash figure in the east, recently seized a large part of Benghazi. In Washington, London and Paris, Western leaders are mulling a concerted military drive against the Islamic State. And in a few months, migrant boats will again put out to sea, plying their desperate trade across the Mediterranean. For Oke, the church watchman, it may be a moment of truth: to pray for the migrants, or join them on their perilous voyage?

The Veterans Room at the Park Avenue Armory -- completed in 1881 by the then-brand-new dream team of Louis Comfort Tiffany, Stanford White, Candace Wheeler and Samuel Colman -- may be as close as any room in New York City comes to such beyond-words fantasia. Depending on which inch you're looking at, it's Islamic, Chinese, Greek, Celtic, Egyptian, Persian or an indefinable mélange of them all, on which no expense was spared. It's never been a secret (the year it opened, this newspaper declared it ''undoubtedly the most magnificent apartment of the kind in this country''), but for decades its glories have been concealed beneath bad repairs, inadequate lighting, brown paint and a patina of Gilded Age cigar smoke. On Monday it reopens to the public in all its historical swagger after more than a year of work, at a cost of more than $8 million, by the Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron, which is overseeing the restoration of the armory, built as a bejeweled boys' club by New York State's Seventh Regiment of the National Guard, the blue-blooded militia that was the first to respond to Lincoln's call for troops in 1861. Since 2009, the armory, a once-crumbling landmark, has transformed itself into one of the world's most sought-after venues for performance, music and supersized art projects. And in a sense, the Veterans Room, of all the Armory's opulent reception rooms (three others have been restored so far), has the deepest spiritual kinship with a work of contemporary art, the feel of an installation by a young collective whose members were reacting to one another and making it all up as they went along. ''I think of it as a preserved experiment,'' said Jason Moran, the pianist and composer, who will be the first artist to use the refurbished room, for a series of performances he will organize through the year. White was only 27 when he began working on the room and had just recently joined the firm that became McKim, Mead & White, which would go on to design Pennsylvania Station. Louis Comfort Tiffany, 31, had only recently switched from painting to glass making. Candace Wheeler, one of America's first female interior designers, was approaching the heights of her powers with textiles and wallpaper. While there are almost no surviving records to indicate what the designers were thinking as they collaborated, some 50 conservators and restorers who worked on the room over the last months, taking it apart almost piece by piece, were able to follow clues that suggested how Tiffany and White, in particular, developed ideas there that flourished later in their careers. (It's the first appearance, for example, of a perforated metal motif that White returned to again and again.) ''I don't think any one person could have conceived of that room,'' said Samuel G. White, an architect and a great-grandson of Stanford White, who has followed the restoration's progress. He recalled seeing the space for the first time more than 30 years ago, when the armory's rooms were still troubled by leaks and collapses. ''It was like opening King Tut's tomb, even in all its dark, degraded condition.'' Rebecca Robertson, the armory's president, said that the room, one of the few surviving interiors by Tiffany, was one of the armory's most intact in its multifarious pieces: ax-hewn California redwood ceiling timbers, with surviving metallic painted designs long hidden; Tiffany windows with red glass that glows blue when the western sunlight strikes from a certain angle; columns wrapped in nautical chains believed to have been used on New York harbor piers; a glass-and-plaster mural over the fireplace depicting what the armory described in 1881 as ''a scaly dragon beating sea into foam, and an eagle (or vulture) making at it with beak and claw.'' ''You have dragons and lizards and sea serpents and fighting birds and Greek and Roman battle scenes and, well, you name it,'' Ms. Robertson said, craning her head toward a ceiling that looked like something out of ''The Arabian Nights.'' ''It's like walking into another world entirely when you come in here,'' she said. ''Understatement was not the plan.'' (The armory's 1881 description of Tiffany's blue-glass mosaic over the fireplace is, itself, a model of overstatement: ''as if a bit of the Atlantic furthest from shore had been caught and pressed into service, with all its indigo held in hard, vitreous clutch.'') Ascan Mergenthaler, a Herzog & de Meuron senior partner who has overseen the restoration, paid for mostly with private funds, said one of the great pieces of luck was the discovery, behind a large painting added to the room in 1910 (now removed), of a patch of the original wallpaper, with a shimmery chain-link pattern in green, copper and aluminum. The firm has approached questions of authenticity with great but not blind reverence, burrowing like archaeologists down to the armory's earliest layers and sometimes leaving evidence of other layers, or adding modern interpretations of elements that were lost. With the wallpaper remnant, the firm had a template to create its own that, along with new gold-hued LED lighting, makes the room seem to float between the 19th and 21st centuries, somewhere between the height of the Aesthetic Movement and the postmodern. ''How can you recreate an artistic process?'' Mr. Mergenthaler asked in a telephone interview from Switzerland. ''You can't read their minds, so you can't just try to do what they did. You have to think beyond that.'' Ms. Robertson led a visitor last week carefully up a narrow winding staircase in the room's northwest corner to a tiny balcony not yet fully restored, lighted by a window masked by a mosquelike rolling glass screen and topped with an elaborate plaster barrel-vaulted ceiling. ''Who knows what they did up here -- speeches, the band?'' she said, laughing and taking in the restored view below, almost completed. ''Tiffany and the others described this as a 'glowing room,''' she said, ''and I think that's really what it does now. It glows.''

It enlisted a recruiting outfit called Talent Market, which helps staff free-market advocacy groups, think tanks and foundations. In two of those cases, the Bradley Foundation, whose efforts Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin drew on, hired candidates whom Talent Market's executive director, Claire Kittle Dixon, had recommended. ''She has a personal knowledge of the conservative movement and lots and lots of contacts,'' said Michael W. Grebe, who is stepping down as the foundation's president this year. Such is the foundation's confidence in Ms. Kittle Dixon that it asked her to assist in finding Mr. Grebe's successor. Unlike many long-established job placement services on the right and the left, which devote most of their efforts to posting ads or advising job-seekers, Talent Market is essentially a full-time recruiting operation. In the case of the Bradley Foundation, Mr. Grebe said, Ms. Kittle Dixon was involved at every step, from writing the job description to unearthing candidates and encouraging them to apply. She is, in effect, the visible hand for those who worship the invisible hand. Libertarian groups and activists backed by deep-pocketed conservative donors have been successful in recent years in pushing beyond Washington into dozens of states. They have provided the intellectual and political muscle for elected officials who have rolled back regulations, cut taxes and tried to remake public education. Perhaps most significantly, they have helped pass anti-union legislation in once heavily unionized states and embarked on well-organized campaigns to discourage workers from paying union dues and fees in liberal bastions like Washington State. ''At the state level, some of these so-called think tanks are beginning to do the real organizing work against unions,'' said Steve Rosenthal, a former A.F.L.-C.I.O. political director who now tracks the flow of conservative money into anti-union efforts. The strategy depends on a cadre of committed recruits, which is where Ms. Kittle Dixon and Talent Market come in. The firm's reason for being, according to its website, is to ensure that the ''free-market nonprofit sector has the talent it needs to defend liberty.'' In this vein, Talent Market says it has helped over 160 organizations find personnel since its founding in 2009, including prominent ones like the Cato Institute, the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Charles Koch Foundation. But it has also been active among more obscure players, ensuring a level of quality control and ideological cohesion at free-market groups across the country. In many ways, Ms. Kittle Dixon is the casting director for the so-called liberty movement. ''The infrastructure for the collectivist left is massive, between academia, government, unions, higher ed, and K-12,'' said Jon Caldara, president of the Independence Institute in Denver, another client. ''For those of us who want to counter that, it's harder to find exactly the right people.'' Talent Market, he said, ''helps take a lot of the mystery out of hiring.'' Ms. Kittle Dixon, who declined to be interviewed, is impeccably credentialed for the role. A protégée of Whitney Ball, a prominent figure in free-market philanthropy, she has toiled for years in the liberty movement. After earning a master's degree in public policy from Georgetown, she worked on talent development at the Koch Foundation in suburban Virginia, where she ran an internship program along with a fellowship known as the Koch Associate Program. She later became research director of a free-market think tank in Ohio. She has crossed paths with hundreds of libertarian wonks and activists over the years and stayed in touch with many of them. ''She is a known quantity, 'persona grata,' '' said Jonathan Rick, who runs a public relations firm and met Ms. Kittle Dixon when he interviewed for the Koch Associate Program in 2006. Job-matching networks that serve a particular ideological niche have been around since at least the 1980s, when the Heritage Foundation created what became a widely trafficked database of jobs with conservative organizations and politicians. Another group called the Leadership Institute has long hosted a job bank and advised young conservatives on how to find entry- to middle-level positions. The left has created a similar infrastructure, with a variety of email lists and message boards connecting activists and operatives with prospective employers. One, called JobsthatareLEFT, started in 2002 ''as a way to help a few unemployed campaign staffers seek lefty jobs,'' according to its Google group page. It says it has shared over 20,000 positions with 25,000 members since then. Another group, called Inclusv, has helped progressives of color land jobs. Paul Oyer, a labor economist at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, said there are two characteristics that make niche matchmaking services successful: If the niche can claim a lot of members, and if not being in the niche is a ''deal breaker'' for those who are in it. Talent Market gives every indication of serving such a niche. To upload a résumé or sign up for the site's newsletter, a candidate must first answer three questions on ''the best way to solve societal problems,'' ''the proper function of government,'' and the prospect's ''view of how markets function.'' (Sample option: ''Free markets almost always lead to the most efficient allocation of resources.'') Like most of the organizations it advises, Talent Market is a nonprofit. It charges clients no fee, subsisting instead on contributions from donors, foundations and other nonprofits. It appears to be a bargain. Talent Market received at least $120,000 a year from 2011 to 2013 from DonorsTrust, a so-called donor-advised fund provider that helps wealthy people contribute anonymously to free-market causes, according to Internal Revenue Service filings. Other conservative and free-market groups, like the State Policy Network and the Vernon K. Krieble Foundation, have contributed over the years. Clients say Talent Market excels at finding hard-to-attract fund-raising staff members and at time-consuming searches for senior officials. But its greatest value may be in connecting far-flung organizations with talent they might not otherwise find. ''Washington, D.C., is one giant high school campus -- everybody knows each other,'' Mr. Caldara, the Denver activist, said. ''But those of us fighting for limited government in the states are spread apart. Sometimes the best person for a job is not someone in our current state.'' Mr. Caldara said his organization recently hired a fund-raiser from the Washington area whom Talent Market brought to its attention. By contrast, Sherry Ettleson, a full-time recruiter for progressive nonprofits who may be the closest counterpart of Ms. Kittle Dixon on the left, says her efforts focus almost entirely on Washington, New York and San Francisco. Ms. Ettleson says this is because she does not have connections outside those cities, and because the network of progressive think tanks and advocacy groups is not as well developed in other regions as it is on the right. ''The left was slow to that game,'' she said. There is almost no corner of the country where Ms. Kittle Dixon has not dispatched conservative crusaders. Since late 2014, according to its monthly newsletter, Talent Market has placed people at the Freedom Foundation in Olympia, Wash.; the Beacon Center of Tennessee in Nashville; the James Madison Institute in Tallahassee, Fla.; and the Ashbrook Center in Ashland, Ohio. Until recently, Michael Schaus lived in Colorado, where he was a freelance writer and the host of a local talk-radio show. Last autumn, he contacted Ms. Kittle Dixon, who encouraged him to pursue his interests in the policy world. Ms. Kittle Dixon, he said, alerted him whenever she came across an opening that fit his ambitions and skills. After the first interview she brokered, Ms. Kittle Dixon contacted him again to see how it had gone and whether she could refine the search further. But in this case, it was unnecessary. The Nevada Policy Research Institute offered him a job as its communications director, and he accepted, attracted by the organization's focus on taxes and education reform. The whole process lasted roughly one month. ''She was good at what she does,'' Mr. Schaus said. ''I love the job. I'm doing the type of stuff I like. It's been a good success.''

23,The New York Times,7-Mar-16,"In a Note, Bob Dylan Told Barbra Streisand, 'You Are My Favorite Star'",The New York Times on the Web,,,By BEN SISARIO,ENGLISH,,,,Section ; Column 0; The Arts/Cultural Desk; Pg.,,Newspaper,,,284 words,,7-Mar-16,,,,,"Of the thousands of lyrics, tapes and correspondence in the Bob Dylan Archive, one of the more intriguing items is a handwritten card from Barbra Streisand, postmarked November 1978, in which she thanks Mr. Dylan for sending flowers and suggests that they make a record together. There is no evidence in the archive of a response from Mr. Dylan. But after seeing an article about the archive last week in The New York Times, Ms. Streisand filled in some of the back story. Here is a statement from her, relayed by a spokesman: I read the recent story in The New York Times about Bob Dylan's archive, and I was so touched to find out he had saved a note from me. It prompted me to go back into my own archive and retrieve a letter I had saved from him. As I remember it, first he sent me flowers and a lovely note, asking me if I would like to sing with him. In return, I sent him the note that's in his archive, thanking him for the flowers and the invitation. But for whatever reason, it never happened at the time. Years later ... when ''Yentl'' was about to come out ... he sent me his latest album, along with the letter I still have. In it, he writes, ''There are some songs on this album which I'm sure you would love to do.'' He adds, ''I'm looking forward to seeing your movie. Maybe you can direct me in one of mine.'' And then he goes on to say something that still means so much to me: ''You are my favorite star. Your self-determination, wit and temperament and sense of justice have always appealed to me.'' I thought scholars, and fans, might like to know the story behind my note. And I plan to send a copy of his letter to Bob, so it can be included in his archive, as well as mine.

The man, James Patrick Dillon, refused to drop a knife and was spewing accelerant from a Corona bottle at a police lieutenant and an inspector when they shot him several times around 5:40 p.m. in his backyard in the Astoria neighborhood, the police said. He was taken to a nearby hospital with gunshot wounds to his leg; the lieutenant and inspector, who sustained chemical burns from the accelerant, were taken to a different hospital in stable condition. The attacks, and the subsequent manhunt, turned a peaceful stretch of businesses and brick homes into a scene of panic and confusion. Officers snaked through backyards and alleyways with their hands on their guns as helicopters circled overhead and residents ducked for cover amid gunfire. Mr. Dillon is accused of killing George Patouhas, 55, the owner of the liquor store, who was known for his friendly greetings and his lenient payment plans. Despite his easy manner, he was often harassed by an aggressive group of men, including Mr. Dillon, some customers said. The police said Mr. Dillon had been treated for psychological problems in the past, and his family reported that he had not been taking his medication recently. He started arguing in the liquor store with a 61-year-old man police officials said might have been homeless, and Mr. Patouhas intervened. After stabbing Mr. Patouhas, he stepped outside and threw an accelerant into the store, setting Mr. Patouhas and the other man on fire. For several hours, the neighborhood's tree-lined streets and small coffee shops and delis were under lockdown as investigators searched grassy patches for evidence and scoured the neighborhood for him. Then, around 5:11 p.m., Mr. Dillon broke into a nearby apartment on 42nd Street and fled down a fire escape, prompting 911 calls, the authorities said. Half an hour later, eight to 10 officers caught sight of Mr. Dillon and ran toward 36th Street, where he lived. As they closed in on his apartment, near the intersection with Astoria Boulevard, around five shots were fired. Officers rushed at the apartment and ordered pedestrians and journalists to keep back. Two residents scampered into their second-floor apartment and took cover as shots rang out, crying, ''What's happening? What's happening?'' Investigators said they recovered a green knife and the Corona bottle. Cristina Squicciarini, 52, who has lived in the neighborhood for decades and heard the officers firing, said, ''You don't think that something would happen on the block you've walked on for 35 years.'' The lieutenant and inspector who were burned are assigned to the Critical Response Command, a unit trained to respond to terrorist attacks. Mr. Dillon has seven prior arrests, most recently on a charge of menacing in 2013 and a marijuana charge in 2009, a law enforcement official said. The other five arrests came when he was a juvenile. The violence began with a knife attack of the kind that has sown fear in subways and on city streets this year, when Mr. Dillon slashed a 39-year-old neighbor in the head and face near 25-69 36th Street around 11:30 a.m. He fled the scene, and the woman was taken to a hospital in stable condition. Around 3 p.m., he began another attack at a liquor store customers said he frequented. Mr. Patouhas was pronounced dead at Mount Sinai Hospital of Queens, and the 61-year-old man was taken to NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, where he was in stable condition. Frank O'Connor, a longtime customer of the liquor store, said of Mr. Patouhas: ''He was such a nice guy, and he would give all these guys favors. They'd say, 'Let me get a pint of vodka, and I'll pay you tomorrow.''' He had helped his father, also called George, sell daisies and roses from a flower stand in a Times Square subway station before striking out on his own and opening the liquor store on Astoria Boulevard decades ago, said a neighbor, Markella Katos, 77. ''He would always stop to say, 'Good morning, Markella. How are you?''' said Ms. Katos, who also recalled how he would help her fix her heat or lights. ''He was a wonderful person and a good neighbor.'' Mr. Patouhas, whose family had roots in Greece, lived with his wife and a young daughter, as well as his wife's relatives, Ms. Katos said. In a New York Times article, he once described having to close the flower shop early because of a water main break; in a later article, his father described fending off people who wanted to use his flower pots as toilets. Mr. Patouhas's liquor shop, too, put him in contact with rowdy men, some of whom badgered him for free merchandise. Mr. O'Connor said Mr. Dillon was one of them, describing him as ''an alcoholic and a druggie'' who was known as Fox. Mr. O'Connor said that on Saturday night Mr. Patouhas ''told me these guys bother him.''

N.Y.C.F.C.'s Thomas McNamara scored the first goal of the new season in spectacular fashion in the 10th minute, taking a feed from Khiry Shelton at the top of the penalty area and curling it into the upper corner. Nine minutes later, Razvan Cocis evened the score on a brilliant run, and he almost scored again a few moments later. Tony Taylor and Shelton both added goals to give N.Y.C.F.C. a 3-1 advantage at halftime. The scoring picked back up after intermission. Chicago's Kennedy Igboananike scored off a turnover and pass from David Accam in the 49th minute. But Diskerud, who was left undefended, restored the two-goal advantage in the 63rd, beating Matt Lampson near-post. Accam scored on a penalty kick following a hand ball by Shelton, but the Fire could not find an equalizer. Later, in a rematch of last year's M.L.S. Cup final, the Portland Timbers defeated the Columbus Crew, 2-1, after Fanendo Adi scored in the 79th minute. U.S. WOMEN DOWN FRANCE Alex Morgan scored a minute into second-half stoppage time, Hope Solo posted her 97th career shutout, and the United States beat France, 1-0, in the SheBelieves Cup in Nashville, Tenn.

On the lone goal, 17-year-old Mallory Pugh controlled the ball just past midfield and passed ahead to Morgan, who sprinted through the defense for a left-footed shot that beat goalkeeper Sarah Bouhaddi. MESSI SCORES 2 FOR BARçA Lionel Messi continued his impressive stretch of play by scoring two goals in Barcelona's 4-0 win at Eibar in the Spanish league, as the strike force of Messi, Luis Suárez and Neymar reached a total of 100 goals this season in all competitions. It was Barcelona's fourth goal, scored by Suárez, that reached the century mark, keeping the three on track to beat the record of 122 they set last season. Messi scored with a great run in the 41st minute and added a penalty kick in the 76th, leaving Barcelona with an 8-point advantage over Atlético Madrid, which won, 3-1, at Valencia to keep pace with 10 games remaining. UNITED FALLS TO WEST BROM Playing with 10 men proved to be no problem for Liverpool in the Premier League, but the same could not be said for Manchester United. Liverpool responded to a red card on James Milner in the 62nd minute at Crystal Palace by coming back after trailing by 1-0. Christian Benteke clinched a 2-1 victory in the sixth minute of injury time with a penalty kick. However, United was made to pay for a 26th-minute red card on Juan Mata -- also for two yellow cards -- at West Bromwich Albion, which won, 1-0, thanks to a goal by Salomón Rondón. United dropped to 3 points behind fourth-place Manchester City in the race for Champions League qualification and is now only 3 ahead of Liverpool, which has won three straight league games for the first time in a year. City has also played one fewer game than United. JUVENTUS RESTORES LEAD Juventus restored its 3-point advantage at the top of the Italian league with a 2-0 win at Atalanta, while Inter Milan boosted its chances of returning to the Champions League with a 3-1 win at Palermo.

Instead, it was adorned with an artistic design he had created for a college class assignment. The reason for the triumph of art over commerce: Podladtchikov, 27, the 2014 Olympic halfpipe champion, no longer has a board sponsor. Snowboarding -- which scarcely existed 30 years ago and took over ski resorts around the world seemingly overnight, adding 5 million participants in two decades -- has tumbled to earth recently. As the sport has been abandoned by participants and advertisers, equipment sales and sponsorship opportunities for athletes have dipped below their peak numbers of five years ago. ''It's gotten really challenging,'' said Podladtchikov's agent, Circe Wallace, a former professional rider. ''We've got one-percenters in snowboarding, and then everyone else fighting for amateur dollars.'' At the U.S. Open in Vail, Colo., one of the final competitive events of the season, the American Louie Vito was eliminated in the halfpipe semifinals Thursday. A 2010 Olympian and a two-time Winter X Games medalist, Vito was one of nearly a dozen riders sponsored by Nike. When the company discontinued its snow-sports division in 2014, several leading pro riders faced an uncertain future because other companies -- many in the midst of slashing their rosters, too -- could not afford to sign them all, reordering the entire market. ''A few bad winters and Nike pulling out meant a lot of good riders without a boot sponsor and an outerwear sponsor,'' said Vito, who also does not have a board sponsor and rides a board with his initials on the bottom. ''It was a problem.'' At the Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, Podladtchikov rode a board with the logo for Quiksilver, a billion-dollar board-sports apparel maker. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in September. Marie Case, the managing director for Board-Trac, a lifestyle research and marketing company focusing on action sports, said retail distribution that carried the culture of board sports across the country eventually proved too much. ''It got oversaturated,'' Case said. A weakened global economy, shifting weather patterns and changing tastes and technology have added up to create a challenging atmosphere for snowboarding. According to the trade group SnowSports Industries America, snowboarding peaked in popularity with nearly 8.2 million participants in the 2010-11 season, declining in each of the next three years. Last season, there was a slight increase, to almost 7.7 million participants, because of growth among those under 17 and women 18 and older. Equipment sales have also declined. According to the National Sporting Goods Association, which tracks retail sales, snowboard equipment sales are down $60 million annually from 2007. SnowSports Industries America has also reported flat or declining equipment sales across skiing and snowboarding during the past five years. Preliminary data from this season indicates that although snowboard equipment sales have increased 25 percent across the Western United States, they are down 4 percent nationally. ''When it comes to retail sales, you have so many factors working for and against you,'' said Nick Sargent, SnowSports Industries' president, who cited Sports Authority's announcement last week that it would file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and close more than 100 stores. ''That's going to have a huge effect on our business.'' Variable snowfall totals have not helped, either. Twenty-five percent of snowboarders live on the West Coast, and California had been in a historic four-year drought until this El Niño season. Snow has also been scarce in the Northeast for much of this winter. ''The original challenge is the weather dependency,'' said John Lacy, the president of Burton Snowboards, an industry pioneer. ''To not have snow across the East Coast for this current winter really has an impact on getting people's mind-set on getting up to the mountain.'' As snowboarding expanded from an outlaw sport banned at most ski resorts to a popular addition to the Olympics, it did so at the expense of Alpine skiing. Participation in that sport has been in free fall, with two million fewer participants than 20 years ago. With the old antagonism between skiers and snowboarders a thing of the past, skiing has co-opted much of the equipment technology, style and attitude of snowboarding. Freeskiing features many of the same tricks, on the same terrain, as snowboarding and grew by nearly a million participants from 2010-11 to 2014-15. Snowboarding and freeskiing are now in the Olympics, the venue in 2014 for Podladtchikov's upset of Shaun White, which was a ratings leader for NBC at the Sochi Games. Another snowboarding discipline, big air, in which riders soar 40 feet while performing tricks for judges, will be added to the program at the 2018 Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Yet television is no longer as dominant a medium for live events like snowboarding. Options for live streaming have affected ratings and advertising revenue and have made the cost of staging events prohibitive, said Chris Stiepock, a vice president for NBC Sports Ventures who, for two decades, worked in a production and marketing role for ESPN's X Games. ''At ESPN, X Games was deemed a phenomenal marketing expense to get young people to watch ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPN.com,'' Stiepock said. ''These days, it's no longer acceptable to chalk up a loss to a marketing loss.'' Television ratings for the Winter X Games are down compared with last year, and viewership for live streaming was up 58 percent this year, said Danny Chi, a spokesman for ESPN. And NBC announced last month that it would no longer stage the Dew Tour, a winter sports competition featuring snowboarding that has been scaled back to one event, from three. Even as television helped take snowboarding into the mainstream, that did not necessarily translate into more riders buying more gear, said Pat Bridges, the creative director at Snowboarder Magazine. Noting that the X Games were typically held in late January and the Winter Olympics in February, after the seasonal peak for equipment sales, Bridges said, ''We've never been a win-on-Sunday, sell-on-Monday phenomenon.''

The results could affect the tenor of the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union, which Slovakia assumes in July, and could color continuing talks on the Continentwide migrant crisis and the future of free movement under the Schengen agreement. Prime Minister Robert Fico's leftist Smer-Social Democracy party, which has governed since 2012, finished first with 28 percent of the vote on Saturday, according to the national Statistical Office, but to form a new government, it will be forced to seek support among several other parties. ''The results that are showing are very complicated, but they show that the political system is very alive,'' Mr. Fico told the daily newspaper SME on Sunday morning. Smer-Social Democracy is projected to hold 49 seats in the 150-seat Parliament, compared with the 83 seats it won in 2012, when it had 44 percent of the vote. The second-place party, Freedom and Solidarity, earned 12 percent of the vote, or 21 seats. The Ordinary People party picked up 11 percent of the vote, while the Slovak National Party, a potential partner for Mr. Fico, received nearly 9 percent, according to official results. Mr. Fico's party ran on an anti-migrant platform, but the biggest surprise was the success of the extreme-right People's Party-Our Slovakia, whose leader, Marian Kotleba, has said, ''Even one immigrant is one too many.'' Mr. Kotleba, a regional governor, has past ties to neo-Nazism. His party picked up 8 percent of the vote, or 14 seats, and could pose an obstacle in Mr. Fico's efforts to form a coalition. Mr. Kotleba has spoken favorably of the Slovak state during World War II and of its leader, Jozef Tiso, who was responsible for sending tens of thousands of Jews to concentration camps. Mr. Kotleba has referred to NATO as a ''criminal organization'' and has railed against the United States, the European Union and immigrants. He is not expected to be offered a role in forming a new government, or to seek one. ''We don't want to join any of the sides at all costs,'' Mr. Kotleba said Sunday in a discussion at TV Markiza. ''We have our clear values, our pillars -- national, Christian and social pillars -- and I think that both sides would mean a debacle for these values.'' Still, the elections make it most unlikely that Slovakia will soften its opposition to being obligated to accept migrants under a European Union quota system. ''We will continue to be the troublemaker in this, but we're not alone,'' said Grigorij Meseznikov, the president of the Institute for Public Affairs here. Mr. Kotleba's success on Saturday baffled politicians and analysts. ''Slovakia is going to have a fascist in the Parliament for the first time, which forces other parties to act very responsibly,'' said Igor Matovic, the leader of Ordinary People. The head of the Slovak National Party, Andrej Danko, said the ''politics of Marian Kotleba belong to the last century.'' Marian Lesko, a political analyst, said the election results showed that Slovaks were growing tired of the old political order, with ties to corruption and scandals, and had decided to vote against ''the system.'' ''It's something that happened in the Czech Republic in the last elections -- the political dinosaurs are leaving,'' Mr. Lesko said on TV Markiza. ''New faces are coming into politics. We will have to get used to them.''  URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/world/europe/ruling-party-in-slovakia-loses-ma jority-in-elections.html"
33,The New York Times,7-Mar-16,Sunset Park Feels the Undertow of Gentrification,Late Edition - Final,,"NEW YORK, NY, USA (96%)",By DAVID GONZALEZ,ENGLISH,,,UNITED STATES (96%),Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; SIDE STREET; Pg. 16,"NEW YORK, USA (96%)",Newspaper,,,1036 words,PHOTO (PHOTOGRAPH BY DAVID GONZALEZ/THE NEW YORK TIMES),7-Mar-16,,,,CITY LIFE (90%); COMMUTING (90%); URBAN TRANSIT SYSTEMS (90%); PARKS & PLAYGROUNDS (78%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (78%); URBAN DEVELOPMENT (78%); ECONOMIC NEWS (78%); COMMERCIAL RENTAL PROPERTY (77%); RETAILERS (77%); CONSTRUCTION (76%); CITIES (73%); CITY GOVERNMENT (73%); RESTAURANTS (72%); OUTDOOR ADVERTISING (72%); GREEN BUILDING (70%); ENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCES (70%); JOB CREATION (68%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (68%); FAMILY (68%); CIVIL RIGHTS (65%); HURRICANE SANDY (64%); LABOR UNIONS (63%); CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS & COMPONENTS (50%),"For decades, the industrial waterfront of Sunset Park, on the western edge of Brooklyn, was an urban flyover country of sorts, as commuters heading to Manhattan or Staten Island zipped past on the elevated Gowanus Expressway, catching glimpses of auto repair shops, huge warehouses and billboards. But now that waterfront is attracting big investment: Deep-pocketed developers are snatching up properties and announcing plans for cutting-edge tech and design companies, commercial ventures, big-box retailers, restaurants and residential towers. The city -- at the urging of developers -- has proposed a streetcar line that would snake along the waterfront from Sunset Park to Astoria, Queens. Developers tout their plans as forward-looking, something that will turn a drab waterfront into a modern, attractive destination and business hub that will generate jobs. City officials say the proposed streetcar is needed to meet the needs of 21st-century commuters and would be welcomed by working-class residents in areas that are far from the subway, like Red Hook in Brooklyn. Before the big money descended on the area, Elizabeth Yeampierre had been working with residents, business owners, planners and advocates on various projects to revive the area, keep rents affordable and retain much-needed jobs in what had been a mostly minority working-class community. As the leader of Uprose, a local environmental justice group founded 50 years ago, she pushed for a waterfront park, made busy streets pedestrian-friendly, helped industrial businesses be more environmentally aware and prepared the neighborhood for another disaster like Hurricane Sandy. Now, some of those accomplishments could displace her neighbors and the workers who may not find a home in a redeveloped waterfront, where for-sale signs abound along with other signs proclaiming ''innovation.'' After years of working with community coalitions, Ms. Yeampierre is confronting development plans she says were imposed on the area without consulting the people who live in the modest houses and apartments east of Third Avenue, the industrial area's border. ''We made this community more green; we made it with amenities, the same ones that developers are using to promote moving to this neighborhood,'' said Ms. Yeampierre, a former civil rights lawyer and a former dean at Yale. ''We call it a displacement economy. If we complain, they say we are against innovation and creativity. The way things are done now is being driven by corporate interests, not by community needs.'' She is part of a coalition that includes labor unions, the Working Families Party, business owners and residents that seeks to maintain a working waterfront, which she estimates currently employs 12,000 people. They are calling for more decent-paying jobs that could blunt the displacement effects of gentrification. For example, they favor using the industrial waterfront for businesses that produce environmentally friendly building and construction materials that would help structures withstand the effects of climate change. These could be the kind of unionized industrial jobs that let a breadwinner support a family, Ms. Yeampierre said. She worries that much of the talk about the area's future developments give little thought to local employment needs beyond entry-level service jobs. ''Commercial jobs just turn young people of color into a servant class for the privileged,'' she said. ''They come in with plans and impose it on the community from the top down. That's the old-school way.'' While Ms. Yeampierre had advocated transportation options to help Sunset Park residents, especially those in public housing, she and others said their calls went unheeded until more upscale projects emerged. The recent streetcar plan, for example, was not dissimilar from one that some Brooklyn residents suggested more than 15 years ago as part of a community-based planning effort. Ronald Shiffman, a former member of the City Planning Commission and professor emeritus at the Pratt Institute, said community plans in 2000 proposed a light-rail system. He said city officials passed on it: One agency said it was not their jurisdiction, while an advisory group for the city said there was no market. The current streetcar proposal, on the other hand, has the support of major developers whose properties line the waterfront. Mr. Shiffman, who has worked with Uprose, said the new proposals for improved transportation and development in Sunset Park, while cast as improving the area and making it more attractive to business and new residents, have only increased the fear of displacement. ''The developers haven't really reached out and worked closely with groups like Uprose,'' he said. ''But every step they are taking looks like one that not only leads to displacement of residential communities but the displacement of jobs for working people who live in the adjacent community. It looks like the gentrification of manufacturing.'' Ms. Yeampierre can see that on the same block of her group's headquarters. Down the street, a hotel rose a few years ago, while a new one is being built around the corner. Next to that site, an auto-repair garage lost its lease. The same fate awaits a radio-repair business whose landlord recently told the business owner that he planned to sell the building. Ms. Yeampierre brightened when she walked through Bush Terminal Park, which her group had promoted for years. It emerged like a vision on the waterfront after passing through a canyon of warehouses and other industrial buildings. ''It took us 15 years for us to get this,'' she said. ''People who work in this neighborhood live in this neighborhood. And now we're going to lose it to gentrification?'' Not that it surprises her. She has seen it happen in other areas of Brooklyn, like Williamsburg and Bushwick, and, more recently, in Port Morris, the would-be ''piano district'' in the South Bronx. ''This country was built on taking and pushing people out, and this is a continuation of that,'' Ms. Yeampierre said. ''Their ads always talk about 'the pioneer spirit.' We call it the new colonization. And there is nothing innovative about colonizing.''

34,The New York Times,7-Mar-16,Women Try to Make Italy's Shoe-Shining as Chic as Its Shoes,Late Edition - Final,,,By GAIA PIANIGIANI,ENGLISH,,,UNITED KINGDOM (90%); ITALY (90%),Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 7,,Newspaper,,,1040 words,"PHOTOS: Eleonora Lovo, 43, in her Verona home, where she runs a shoe-shining business, and, left, her worktable. ''I don't think it's a job for men only,'' Ms. Lovo said. ''I have always loved men's shoes.'' (PHOTOGRAPHS BY ALESSANDRO GRASSANI FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)",7-Mar-16,,,,FOOTWEAR (90%); MEN (89%); WOMEN (78%); WORLD WAR II (77%); WAXES (66%); HOTELS & MOTELS (65%),"VERONA, Italy --  In a country famed for its fine leather products and fashion sense, shining shoes was never a particularly exalted profession. The practice was imported during World War II, when American and British soldiers paid young boys on the street to buff up their boots, sometimes in return for chocolate and cigarettes. Even one of the ways to call it -- ''sciuscià,'' as described in Vittorio De Sica's 1946 movie of the same name -- comes from the Neapolitan dialect that imitates the sound of the English ''shoeshine.'' And it was certainly never a woman's job. But don't tell any of that to Eleonora Lovo. She is the latest example of how women have moved into the decidedly out-of-fashion trade, once exclusively the domain of men, and even made it hip. Today the 43-year-old Ms. Lovo walks around Verona in black men's shoes, a stretchy below-the knee skirt, a white shirt and ample, black oval eyeglasses. From her forearm hangs a rectangular brown leather bag full of attentively polished shoes, which she picks up and returns to clients herself. Ms. Lovo's laboratory is a corner of her family's living room. Sitting on a wooden chair on a recent day, surrounded by art books, beeswax, colored cream polishes, all sorts of brushes and a cuckoo clock, she started brushing off the dust and dirt from one of her ''babies,'' and described the work that is her passion. ''I don't think it's a job for men only,'' Ms. Lovo said. ''I have always loved men's shoes. They have a history, for the models, the ways they are sewed together. Women's shoes simply don't.'' The second woman in Italy to gain renown for choosing the job in recent years, Ms. Lovo began her business out of her home, and at several business congresses, hotels and shoe fairs, in 2014. From there her reputation spread. But before she started, she learned the art and craft of treating leather from books and at a local tannery, and started polishing shoes for her family and friends. ''While I was learning, I once ruined a friend's fine shoes,'' she recalled with anguish. ''I couldn't sleep that night.'' ''My challenge is to give them a new life,'' she added, smiling, while cleaning a pair of decade-old brown American shoes with a blue microfiber cloth soaked in a delicate liquid detergent. ''My favorite thing about my job is to see my customers' faces when they unpack their polished shoes.'' While she polishes mostly men's shoes, Ms. Lovo owes her success mostly to women, she conceded. On one hand, she has taken the place of the traditional Italian housewife, whose chores included cleaning shoes. Now most women work outside the home and no longer have the time for the task. On the other hand, her very first promoters were her fellow soccer moms. ''Some moms first asked me to clean their leather bags, and then they spread the word,'' she said, explaining that women are also her principal promoters on social media. ''Men, in turn, trust women for these kinds of jobs. For them, it's like entrusting their shoes to their mothers or girlfriends.'' Ms. Lovo is not Italy's first shoeshine woman. In 2000, another female entrepreneur, Rosalina Dallago, 51, opened a shoeshine shop in Rome's city center. A former model and later a restaurateur, Ms. Dallago has gently brushed the shoes of Italy's elites, including the actor Alberto Sordi and assorted politicians. Her tiny, narrow shop, she likes to say, is nested between the ''sacred'' -- the San Lorenzo in Lucina church -- and the ''profane'' -- the lower house of Parliament. ''You know, when I took over his shop, the 72-year-old owner gave me his brushes,'' Ms. Dallago said, gently passing wooden brushes made of horsehair. ''It was a real baton passing. I felt like crying.'' In 16 years, Ms. Dallago's career rapidly expanded. She has run a shoeshine corner inside Fiumicino airport, and another in a Roman club; had a 12-minute national television program; and held entrepreneurship courses for women. She collaborates with a female cobbler. All of her enterprises are managed by women. Her business, portrayed as a glamorous and sexy new way of shoe-shining, made headlines in publications all over the world, from Germany to Japan. Her fame, however, still did not generate much competition until Ms. Lovo came along, 500 kilometers, or about 310 miles, to the north. ''It's a job that makes your hands dirty, and stay bent all day long,'' Ms. Dallago said with a smirk. ''Not many women, and people in general, like it.'' Traditionally, shoe-shining is considered a humble job in Italy, one not in demand for decades. Its ranks grew even thinner in recent years. While it is common to see shoe-shiners at international airports or in shopping areas in the United States or Britain, a city like Rome had fewer than 10 shoe-shiners even in the golden era of the 1950s. And all of them were men. ''It was a historically men-dominated job -- only now things are changing a bit,'' said Tommaso Cancellara, the chief executive at Micam, Italy's main shoe fair. Mr. Cancellara said that although shoe-shining was still considered a humble job and clients could be somewhat haughty in Italy, the use of professional shoe cream polishes was on the rise. Stores offering a barbershop, shoe-shining service and shirt shopping all together have opened since 2014 in cities around Italy. ''That to me suggests that Italians are fed up with the crisis, and at least enjoy a moment of personal joy,'' he said, adding that men no longer spend much money on holidays or clothing, but they do treat themselves a bit. ''They have their shoes professionally shined and go to the barber's shop,'' Mr. Cancellara explained. ''I doubt any man complains it's a woman attending his shoes.'' Being a woman in the profession, Ms. Lovo and Ms. Dallago agree, can indeed be an advantage. The latter recounted flowers or Cartier boxes she had rejected through the years, but she said none ever made her feel like the ''Mata Hari of the year 2000.'' Ms. Lovo has a different attitude. ''I am a gentleman woman,'' Ms. Lovo said, smiling under her salt-and-pepper disheveled bob. ''I can't see well-dressed men walking in dirty shoes. That's simply why I started polishing shoes.''

Ossining, N.Y. -- LAST month, samples showed a spike in the amount of radioactive tritium being discharged from Indian Point Energy Center into the groundwater near our homes along the Hudson River. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo ordered several state agencies to carry out an inspection of the nuclear plant just 45 miles north of midtown Manhattan; the Nuclear Regulatory Commission also sent inspectors. This radioactive spill is far from the first malfunction at Indian Point, which opened over 50 years ago. In the last year alone, Indian Point has suffered seven major malfunctions -- pump and power failures,  a transformer explosion, radiation leaks, a fire and an oil spill. Governor Cuomo has ordered a further, full investigation and now says that all these accidents demonstrate that Indian Point can no longer operate safely. We agree. Malfunctions can happen at any power plant, but they are happening with disturbing frequency at Indian Point. Its age is problematic, and its safety is doubtful. The licenses for Indian Point's two reactors expired in 2013 and 2015; the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is still weighing whether to renew them. In 2007, Barack Obama called the commission a ''moribund agency'' that was a captive of the industry it regulated. It still looks that way today. The commission seems to accept the word of Indian Point's operator, Entergy, that basic safety and environmental cleanup measures aren't necessary, even after the latest mishaps. The commission even permits Indian Point to evade its own safety standards requiring that the electrical cables that control emergency reactor shutdowns have insulation that would last 60 minutes in a fire -- giving the plant an exemption after finding that this insulation lasted just 27 minutes. Poor maintenance at Indian Point has caused groundwater radiation levels to soar to 740 times federal limits, yet the commission just handed Entergy a five-year delay of the deadline for testing for possible leaks from the No. 2 reactor -- the suspected source of this latest leak of radioactive contamination. The commission admits that tritium in the groundwater will reach the Hudson River and that the radioactive isotope, for which there is no safe dose, can cause cancer. Indian Point also has about 1,500 tons of radioactive waste in the form of spent fuel rods packed into pools. These, too, are leaking radiological contamination that violates the Clean Water Act. In addition, the plant's cooling system has devastating effects on the Hudson's ecology, killing more than a billion fish, eggs and larvae each year as it draws millions of gallons of water per day from the river. The commission has reported that one of Indian Point's reactors has the highest risk of all the country's reactors of being damaged by an earthquake, and federal studies show that Indian Point is incredibly vulnerable to acts of terrorism. Tens of millions of people live within the reach of an Indian Point nuclear disaster. An evacuation would be practically impossible and emergency responses would be largely futile. A recent poll in the Lower Hudson Valley found that a majority of respondents do not trust the plant's safety or its operator. The fact is that we have enough power capacity to permit the immediate closure of Indian Point. Indian Point is able to generate just over 2,000 megawatts of electricity, or about 10 percent of peak summer demand in the New York metropolitan area. According to Riverkeeper's calculations, however, we already have an additional 1,500 megawatts of energy capacity from other sources: existing electricity surpluses in New York State, recently restored power generation from plants in the Hudson Valley and New York City, together with transmission improvements in the power grid in the lower Hudson Valley and targeted energy efficiency gains by Con Edison. The New York Independent System Operator, a nonprofit agency charged with managing the state's electricity market, indicated in a report last year that there would be a net reliability ''need'' of 500 megawatts if Indian Point was to shut down before this summer. Since that study, though, downstate load forecasts for this summer have dropped by about 500 megawatts, thanks in part to increases in solar power installations. In short, we can close Indian Point now and reliably keep the lights on. In the future, new efficiency and renewable energy projects will drive still greater savings, thanks to $5 billion in planned energy investments by the state. We no longer have to rely on this aging, unsafe nuclear plant. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission should cancel Indian Point's operating licenses immediately and start overseeing an orderly closing.

There is a lot to be said for happiness. Ask Joe Rahon. A 6-foot-2 junior guard, he had 10 points, 10 rebounds and 4 assists on Saturday night as St. Mary's defeated Loyola Marymount here in the quarterfinals of the West Coast Conference's tournament. Coming out of high school in San Diego, Rahon envisioned having that kind of performance at the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament, before a huge, rabid crowd. It was a dream that prompted Rahon to fly across the country to play under Steve Donahue at Boston College. It's a miscalculation made each year by naïve 18-year-old recruits, attracted by the image of the big conferences, with their glamorous head coaches and phenomenal facilities. ''I was going to be a building block of the program,'' Rahon said Saturday, recalling that he had looked forward to playing at Duke, at North Carolina, against Syracuse at the Carrier Dome. After two years at Boston College, though, Rahon had had enough -- enough of the losing, enough of the futility. In his sophomore season, 2013-14, Boston College finished 8-24, its worst record since joining the A.C.C. in 2005. Donahue was fired with two years left on his contract. ''After two years, the competitor in me was saying, 'This is really cool, but I want to win,' '' Rahon said. He headed to St. Mary's and sat out the 2014-2015 season because of the N.C.A.A.'s transfer rules, an agonizing exercise but one that enabled Rahon time to acclimate to the West Coast and adjust to his new situation. There would be trade-offs. ''You're playing smaller gyms, fewer people in the crowd,'' Rahon said, ''but when you're playing for a championship and you're playing games that are really meaningful, into late February and early March, it kind of makes up for the big arenas and atmosphere that you get in the A.C.C.'' I enjoy the midmajor conference tournaments, including the W.C.C.'s. They are defined by a sense of hope that gives March Madness its high-wire excitement. In recent years, though, income inequality in sports -- supposedly the epitome of a level playing field -- has become discouraging. Again and again, with a few exceptions, the hope that the conference tournaments inevitably engender has met a swift end in the N.C.A.A. tournament. I have become obsessed with the idea of creating March Madness parity to consistently allow the great midmajor basketball teams in any given year to reach the N.C.A.A. tournament's Final Four. I envision parallel tournaments, one made up of midmajors and one of programs from the so-called Power Five conferences. The top two teams in each tournament would meet in a reconfigured Final Four. I shared my vision with the W.C.C.'s commissioner, Lynn Holzman, who knows, as I do, that such an arrangement is impossible but also knows that there must be a change in the landscape. Still, for all of the inequities of the current system, Holzman likes the long-shot nature of the N.C.A.A. tournament, which makes midmajors perennial underdogs. ''I still think there is something magical about the field of 68 and playing in the N.C.A.A. championship,'' she said. ''We're obsessed with the Cinderella story and the possibility that the 16th seed is going to beat the No. 1 seed.'' Provided they avoid upsets on Monday, St. Mary's and Gonzaga will play on Tuesday for the W.C.C. tournament title. Each team appears to be on the bubble for making the N.C.A.A. tournament and may need the conference's automatic bid to prolong its season. Gonzaga has the added pressure of trying to extend its streak of consecutive N.C.A.A. tournament appearances to 18. Regardless of which team moves on, though, it will be an underdog once the N.C.A.A. tournament begins next week. ''Some might say that Gonzaga is no longer a Cinderella story, but I think it still is,'' Holzman said. ''When you look at how many midmajors actually get to the Final Four, it's rare.'' David Carter, a St. Mary's assistant and a former head coach at Nevada, was on the 1988-89 St. Mary's team that reached the N.C.A.A. tournament but lost to Clemson in its opener. For Carter, the difference between that year and this one is exposure. In 1989, there was little opportunity for fans across the country to be exposed to conferences like the W.C.C. ''You were more amped up to see what you could do,'' Carter said of playing as a midmajor in the national tournament. ''It was more of a David-and-Goliath approach to the tournament because people across the county never saw you play.'' Today, programs at every level get exposure. Even high school teams get exposure. ''You're on television quite a bit,'' Carter said. ''You have parity in basketball. Teams in the West Coast Conference feel they can play against anyone in the country.'' Carter said that in his playing days, players at midmajors who did not have much experience against the nation's top teams always had doubts. ''You weren't sure if you're good enough,'' Carter said, describing their attitude as ''let's go prove ourselves.'' ''But now,'' Carter added, ''I think people see you, see your team and see how good you are, so it's not a big surprise when you beat a team from a big-five conference.'' The Power Five conferences still attract the top players, and recruits like Rahon will invariably pick one of those teams over a midmajor. Many, though, will eventually transfer. At that point, it's no longer about getting to the N.B.A. but about enjoying the experience -- winning a regular-season title or a conference tournament championship and taking your shot in the N.C.A.A. tournament. It's about feeling productive. ''I wanted to win,'' Rahon said. ''I wanted a chance to make the tournament, a chance to play for a league championship.

''Have you ever wondered what an 18th-century punk would look like?'' Ms. Kawakubo's husband, Adrian Joffe, asked before the show. Mr. Joffe also happens to be president of Comme des Garçons International and the conduit of his wife's oracular explanations. ''You're about to find out.'' It began with rose festooned damask and pastoral jacquards, shaped into garlands that wreathed the body, and boned corsetry and panniers reimagined as armadillo-like scales, sliced into articulated armor on the arms and legs. Leather breastplates brushed with pastel blooms became a bristling carapace (and so did petal pink vinyl), and nylon saddle bags in fuchsia and fire opal melted into giant hexagonal mouths, like a carnivorous lily. If Marie Antoinette had wanted to play samurai warrior at her Versailles faux farm instead of milkmaid, this would have been what she would wear. Except that Ms. Kawakubo's work has never been about dress-up, despite her having little or no interest in putting on the runway what most people would characterize as regular clothes. It has to do, rather, with drawing unexpected but powerful connections in entirely visceral ways via the stuff that covers the body. Which, in this case, had to do with a reminder of a time that was ''all about revolution,'' said Mr. Joffe: the French Revolution, the American Revolution, the Industrial Revolution. A time when, in other words, the 99 percent rose up against the 1 percent and machines changed the world economy. Recognize the pattern? Those who don't learn from history, etc. Paris was full of teachable moments over the weekend. Sometimes they were as simple as Haider Ackermann's continued refinement of his own point of view, this time with a silhouette sharp and thin as a straight razor -- cropped legging-like trousers, striped like a tuxedo pant or two-tone, front and back -- plus a square-shouldered military coat, sweeping or cropped no matter, doused in jewel-tones of ruby, emerald and gold. Or Guillaume Henry's ability to learn from his own mistakes at Nina Ricci, and abandon transparent styling tricks for smudgy seduction in a ''sporty bourgeois,'' Romy Schneider-inspired show of lace and crushed-velvet slipdresses, key-hole slinks, and pencil skirts and organza tops under eelskin trench coats. (It was more worthy of study, anyway, than Fausto Puglisi's leopard-meets-chrysanthemum empty femininity at Emanuel Ungaro.) Sometimes they were more abstract, as in Phoebe Philo's primer at Céline on the importance of curiosity and ''finding the possibilities'' -- in wardrobes, fabrics, ''life in general'' (her words, backstage after the show). Which in this case meant flared jersey trousers that swished with a step under almost everything: oversize shirts with pointy piped collars and sleeveless trench coats; skinny nylon tunics stretched long and silver screen satins knotted on a hip; and balloon bouclés. You never know what rules deserve to be broken, and what goes with what, until you try. In the awkwardness and angst of odd pairings, new ideas arise. And sometimes they were interdisciplinary, as in Junya Watanabe's dazzling three-dimensional exploration of Euclidean geometry and the functional application of sacred mathematics to everyday form. Who needs a ruffle when they can have a polyhedron? On a simple black leotard base, under black bathing caps, he used what looked like squishy neoprene but turned out to be an industrial fabric made from polyurethane bonded to nylon (who knew?) that was cut and folded and otherwise formed it into honeycombed tunics and skirts hipped in hexagonal origami; tops that resembled Escher staircases and dresses that undulated in waves over the torso. The effect was of a problem, elegantly solved. Coincidentally, Yohji Yamamoto also had math on the mind, titling his show ''Subtraction,'' and stripping away extraneous color and decoration, the better to create his own equation: long, precisely cut coats and dresses with spiky lapels, sailor collars and the occasional splash of graffiti for emphasis. But it was Jun Takahashi at Undercover who added poetry to the syllabus. (Sorry: schedule.) To the tune of Lou Reed's ''Perfect Day,'' he celebrated comfort dressing (fuzzy bedroom slippers and bathrobe coats, silk pajama sets and warm tweeds) as well as women in all their forms, from youth to retirement age, portraits to priestesses. Though whether the implication was that said women deserve comfort or provide it was unclear. The answer is probably both. (It should be.) They came with their own pillow handbags, sporting giant stuffed bugs as brooches, and crowned by golden antlers. They came in a gold breastplate (this is, bizarrely, something of a thing this season) over a billowing evening gown or the most homespun of knits, the sort a clan grandmother might make, or enveloped in a faux fur sweatsuit, giant striped scarves trailing behind like a train. And in every incarnation, they looked like royalty -- of the most democratic kind. Dream on and study up. Check out our complete Paris Fashion Week coverage here.

The video project was started with a grant from Christopher Buck. Retro Report has a staff of 13 journalists and 10 contributors led by Kyra Darnton. It is a nonprofit video news organization that aims to provide a thoughtful counterweight to today's 24/7 news cycle. Previous episodes are at nytimes.com/retroreport. To suggest ideas for future reports, email retroreport@nytimes.com  It may not strike everyone as the loftiest ambition: creating machines that are smarter than people. Not setting the bar terribly high, is it? So the more cynical might say. All the same, an array of scientists and futurists are convinced that the advent of devices with superhuman intelligence looms in the not-distant future. The prospect fills some of our planet's brainiest specimens with dread. They include certified smart men like Bill Gates of Microsoft, the physicist Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk, head of SpaceX. Messrs. Hawking and Musk have been especially grim. ''The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race,'' Mr. Hawking told the BBC in 2014. At about the same time, Mr. Musk worried that ''with artificial intelligence, we are summoning the demon,'' a fiend that he feared would become ''our biggest existential threat.'' When people of their caliber speak, it seems reasonable to listen. And so, alarms about a computer-spawned apocalypse are a backdrop to the latest installment in the Retro Report series, video documentaries that explore major news events of the past and their continuing effects. Men of science are not alone in the hand-wringing over the possibility of machines running wild. Asked what they feared most, Americans interviewed by researchers at Chapman University in Southern California ranked the consequences of modern technology near the top. Even death did not rattle them as much; it was way down on their list of worries, at No. 43. While not discounting that doomsayers may prove someday to be right, Retro Report offers more reassuring views from computer specialists who sense that the end is not nigh -- if only, they say, because machines are not nearly as clever, or necessarily as pernicious, as the fretters believe. Jitters over humanity's falling victim to various creations are as old Mary Shelley's Frankenstein monster and the Golem of Jewish tradition. Hostile robots have been on the scene since at least the 1920s with the play ''R.U.R.,'' by the Czech writer Karel Capek. The initials stood for ''Rossum's Universal Robots.'' Indeed, this work introduced ''robot'' into the language. Since then, run-amok machines have been a science-fiction staple in books and films like ''Colossus: The Forbin Project,'' ''I, Robot,'' ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' ''Transcendence,'' ''Ex Machina'' and the seemingly inexhaustible supply of ''Terminator'' movies. One sure bet about those films is that, like the Terminator itself, they'll be back. On occasion, machines are cast as a benign presence, as in the 2013 film ''Her,'' in which a man finds intimacy with an operating system that is guided by artificial intelligence (not to mention made alluring by the voice of Scarlett Johansson). In Japan, some people have closely bonded with robot dogs, to the point of holding funerals for automated pooches that cease to function. More typically, though, the machines -- robots, cyborgs, androids, clones -- are depicted as threats to human survival. As Retro Report recalls, fear of them in real life grew in 1997 when a chess-playing IBM computer, Deep Blue, defeated the world champion, Garry Kasparov. Apprehension deepened for some in 2011 when two stars of the quiz show ''Jeopardy!'' were soundly defeated by a new IBM gizmo. (What is Watson?) This week, artificial intelligence will again challenge the human brain as Google's DeepMind competes in South Korea against a champion in Go, the Chinese board game with trillions of possible moves. Arguably, there is no reason to lose sleep over those souped-up gadgets. Sure, Watson and its brethren are good at games and other sorts of data processing. But contemplating a takeover of the world's nuclear arsenals? Not a chance. Nonetheless, some experts foresee a time, not far off, when artificial intelligence, A.I., will match and then exceed human intelligence, at ever-accelerating and frightening speeds. ''Shortly after, the human era will be ended,'' Vernor Vinge, a computer scientist and science fiction author, wrote in 1993. That moment, he predicted, would come ''within 30 years.'' In other words, check your calendars -- a mere seven years remain until the arrival of this ''technological singularity,'' as it was called. Another A.I. expert, Raymond Kurzweil, has pinpointed 2045 as the due date. Still another student of the subject, James Barrat, also says that once the machines blow past us, man's reign is through. ''We humans steer the future not because we're the strongest beings on the planet, or the fastest, but because we are the smartest,'' Mr. Barrat has said. ''So when there is something smarter than us on the planet, it will rule over us on the planet.'' Horrific scenarios abound. Superintelligent computers will cause global financial systems to collapse. They will wage war on humans with killer robots far more lethal than today's drones. They will control nuclear weaponry -- think Skynet in the ''Terminator'' series -- to dominate humankind or, worse, wipe it out. In these grim predictions, the machines always seem to be anthropomorphic: Their instincts are essentially the same as those of humans at their worst; just as people have run roughshod over lower life forms, artificial intelligence networks will abuse their supremacy. Possibilities for them to do good -- figuring out how to regenerate human cells, for instance, or creating immunities against disease, or gobbling up carbon dioxide in the atmosphere -- tend to get short shrift. For some analysts, any worry about human survival is theoretical and certainly less immediate than more prosaic, yet vital, concerns. Technological advances have enhanced the ability of governments to spy on their citizens. How to shape policy is now reflected in the struggle between Apple and the Obama administration over access to the iPhone of one of the terrorists in the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., in December. Economic issues are unavoidable as well. Lawrence H. Summers, president emeritus at Harvard University and a former Treasury secretary, noted that unemployment is disproportionately higher among those whose duties ''in various ways have been mechanized.'' There are ''important consequences for the way the economy is organized and for how fair the economy is,'' Mr. Summers said in an interview with Retro Report. There is, too, a question of how smart robots truly are and whether they can develop superintelligence at the blinding speed envisioned by the more pessimistic forecasters. ''Things that are easy for humans are hard for computers,'' Guruduth S. Banavar, the director of cognitive computing research at IBM, told Retro Report, ''and things that are easy for computers are hard for humans.'' Yes, a computer can multiply two numbers of 1,000 digits each in a matter of seconds. But it cannot hold a candle to a toddler when it comes to recognizing faces or performing a task as simple as climbing steps. Perhaps it is human nature to assume the worst with something new. ''Humans often converge around massive technological shifts -- around any change, really -- with a flurry of anxieties,'' Adrienne LaFrance, who covers technology for The Atlantic magazine, wrote a year ago. But it is too soon for hyperventilating, Fei-Fei Li, a professor of computer science at Stanford University, told Retro Report. With A.I., she said, ''we are closer to a washing machine than a Terminator.''  URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/us/smart-robots-make-strides-but-theres-no-nee d-to-flee-just-yet.html"

In Maine, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont won the Democratic caucuses on Sunday, according to The Associated Press. The victory in Puerto Rico came a day after Mr. Rubio was shut out of first-place finishes in all four of Saturday's Republican nominating contests. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas won the caucuses in Kansas and Maine, and Donald J. Trump won the Kentucky caucuses and the Louisiana primary. The 23 delegates awarded to Mr. Rubio from Puerto Rico still leave him trailing far behind Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump. Saturday's results helped Mr. Cruz emerge as the main alternative for Republicans hoping to halt Mr. Trump's momentum. Mr. Cruz has now beaten Mr. Trump, who holds the lead in delegates, in six states. Mr. Rubio's lone previous victory came in the Minnesota caucuses. Mr. Rubio -- who in recent days has focused on his home state, which he must win in its March 15 primary if he hopes to continue his campaign -- made a detour to Puerto Rico on Saturday, campaigning in San Juan and holding a news conference, mostly in Spanish, in a last-minute push to win the primary. Puerto Rico, which has roughly 3.7 million residents, could help Mr. Rubio in his home state's primary. More than one million Puerto Ricans live in Florida, concentrated most heavily around Orlando, and many were closely watching their island's contest Sunday. Puerto Rico is embroiled in a debt crisis, with the territory facing a deficit of more than $70 billion. Mr. Rubio took a tough line on the matter in Congress, urging Puerto Rico to focus on improving its economy and fixing its troubled fiscal situation rather than seeking bankruptcy protection. Mr. Sanders's win in Maine was his third of the weekend, and he assured supporters he still had ''a path toward victory'' and urged the news media not to ''write us off.'' It came a day after he won the caucuses in Kansas and Nebraska. But Hillary Clinton, Mr. Sanders's Democratic rival, also notched a decisive victory on Saturday, beating him in the Louisiana primary. On Tuesday, Michigan will hold its primary, a critical test for both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders as the nominating contests incorporate Rust Belt states. On Sunday night, the Democratic debate was held in Flint, Mich., where the water crisis was the primary focus. Mrs. Clinton campaigned in Detroit on Friday, laying out her job growth plan, which includes providing incentives for employers to invest in the United States and ''clawing back'' tax incentives from companies that move their business overseas. For Mr. Sanders, Michigan -- with its working-class voters who may be receptive to his populist message -- is the sort of state he needs to win to remain viable and prove he can beat Mrs. Clinton, who decimated him in the South with the strong backing of African-American voters.

Trump's march to their party's presidential nomination emerged from the weekend's voting contests newly emboldened by Mr. Trump's uneven electoral performance and by some nascent signs that he may be peaking with voters. Outside groups are moving to deploy more than $10 million in new attack ads across Florida and millions more in Illinois, casting Mr. Trump as a liberal, a huckster and a draft dodger. Mr. Trump's reed-thin organization appears to be catching up with him, suggesting he could be at a disadvantage if he is forced into a protracted slog for delegates. And vote tallies on Saturday made clear that Mr. Trump has had at least some trouble building upon his intensely loyal following, leaving him increasingly dependent upon landslides in early voting. In Louisiana, where Mr. Trump amassed a lead of more than 20 percentage points among those who cast votes before Saturday, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas effectively tied him among voters who cast their ballots on Saturday. ''Trump has to worry about the consistent late-voter rejection of his candidacy,'' said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and Republican presidential candidate. Mr. Trump's losses to Mr. Cruz in Kansas and Maine on Saturday, coupled with closer-than-expected victories in Louisiana and Kentucky, have heightened the prospects for a two-man race, though many Republican leaders eye Mr. Cruz warily. As his rivals have despaired over the race's vulgar turn, Mr. Trump struck a subdued tone, by his standards, as returns came in late Saturday night. He aborted his first attempt to take the stage and left the room after asking reporters if the race in Kentucky had been called. When he finally did speak, some of his usual bombast was missing, even as he insisted that it was time for Senator Marco Rubio to quit the race and that Mr. Cruz cannot win more moderate northeastern or coastal states. ''Donald Trump was uncharacteristically low energy,'' Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee in 2012, said in an interview Sunday on NBC's ''Meet the Press,'' taunting Mr. Trump with the insult Mr. Trump had employed against Jeb Bush. Yet despite the renewed optimism of his opponents, the path to deny Mr. Trump the nomination remains narrow and arduous. Mr. Cruz's emergence as the most credible alternative to Mr. Trump has proved both a boost and a complication for those seeking to derail the New Yorker. Mr. Cruz has tried to undercut calls for a contested convention to deny Mr. Trump the nomination, which Mr. Cruz says would yield a ''manifest revolt'' among voters. But Mr. Cruz has done little so far to threaten Mr. Trump's lead in the delegate race. Much of Mr. Cruz's late-breaking support on Saturday seemed to come at the expense of Mr. Rubio, not Mr. Trump. And the Cruz campaign's message of ideological purity and religious faith is a less natural fit for many of the delegate-rich Midwestern and coastal states that remain on the map. ''Saturday proved that Trump can be contained and even beaten,'' said Scott Jennings, a longtime Republican strategist, who looked ahead to this summer's Republican convention in Cleveland. ''The question is whether the field is going to allow for it moving forward. The most likely scenarios remain that Trump gets enough before Cleveland, or nobody does. The latter moved a little closer to realistic Saturday.'' Mr. Rubio's path is much less certain, despite his lopsided victory in Puerto Rico on Sunday. Even his supporters said that the results on Saturday seriously undercut the premise of his bid: that he is the only candidate who can unify the Republican Party and defeat Mr. Trump. ''Look, I'm supportive of Marco; I'm very hopeful,'' said Mel Martinez, the former senator from Florida, who had supported Mr. Bush. ''But it's a great concern that time has kind of caught up with this whole thing.'' The Stop Trump forces are beginning to pour money into television ads, with a particular focus on the big states voting on March 15. Four different groups have reserved at least $10 million in airtime in Florida so far, according to trackers of media spending. That number is expected to grow, but television stations in Florida are already awash in such ads. Two from the American Future Fund, which has spent $2 million so far in Florida and Illinois, show decorated veterans assailing Mr. Trump as a poseur on military matters. Michael Waltz, a retired Special Forces colonel, blisteringly calls Mr. Trump a draft dodger and, effectively, a coward. ''Donald Trump hasn't served this country a day in his life,'' he says. ''Don't let Trump fool you.'' And a former prisoner of war in Vietnam, Tom Hanton, bluntly questions Mr. Trump's toughness: ''Trump would not have survived the P.O.W. experience. He would have been probably the first one to fold.'' Separately, Club for Growth Action, an arm of the anti-tax group that was the first to run ads in Iowa against Mr. Trump, has placed $2 million in commercials attacking him in Illinois on top of $1 million in Florida. A third group, Our Principles PAC, which was created to defeat Mr. Trump, has reserved $3.5 million in Illinois and Florida and is also sending direct mail to voters' homes in Florida. A group supporting Mr. Rubio, Conservative Solutions, is spending several million dollars in Florida as well. The deluge of negative messages from a patchwork of groups -- highlighting claims by angry customers of Mr. Trump's defunct educational company and his history of shape-shifting positions -- already appears to have hurt Mr. Trump's cause. In conversations with some of his allies, who insisted on anonymity to relay those private talks, Trump campaign aides have expressed concern about the money being spent against him on television. The Trump campaign has no pollster, so it is governed by public polling and what the candidate himself observes while watching cable news. This off-the-cuff approach, and a string of self-inflicted wounds -- refusing to clearly and immediately reject the support of the white supremacist David Duke, boasting about his sexual endowment on the debate stage and withdrawing from the Conservative Political Action Committee's conference over the weekend -- have fueled days of unfavorable coverage of Mr. Trump's candidacy. ''Trump has total disdain for the professional political class,'' said Scott Reed, a veteran Republican strategist. ''He thinks they're all about making money. Pollsters are hacks. Organization doesn't matter. Their idea of a political organization is taking phone calls from some elected officials who wanted to endorse and making it work in the schedule. And that'll catch up with you eventually.'' Still, members of the Republican establishment have been left to grapple with what was once unthinkable: rallying around Mr. Cruz, a senator who built his reputation bashing them. ''Some hope with Ted, no hope with Donald,'' Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said on ''Meet the Press,'' summarizing the party's dim view of its remaining options. Neither, he suggested, would be likely to expand the Republican tent: ''We're in a demographic death spiral.'' Less than two weeks ago, Mr. Graham joked about murdering Mr. Cruz on the Senate floor. And yet, Mr. Graham said, he received a phone call from Mr. Cruz after Super Tuesday -- part of efforts by the Cruz campaign to reach out, discreetly, to donors and party officials who might be interested in rallying around him. With Mr. Rubio faltering badly across the board on Saturday, Mr. Cruz is moving to compete aggressively in Florida. He has also weighed the merits of a significant push in Ohio, the home state of Gov. John Kasich. Both states are winner-take-all, and the Cruz campaign insists it would only dedicate substantial resources if it thought it could win outright. But the effort is risky: It could boost Mr. Trump, if Mr. Cruz diminishes his non-Trump rivals without a victory. The Cruz campaign says it can reach the requisite delegate threshold of 1,237 without winning Florida or Ohio, thanks to its superior organization in later-voting states, many of which are closed to non-Republicans. But several party strategists have disputed this math, even if the contests on March 15 force some of Mr. Cruz's competitors from the race. A moment of reckoning for Mr. Rubio will come Tuesday in Michigan, a state that has concentrations of the kinds of voters he performs well with: professional, younger, highly educated and upper-income. But a poll released on Sunday by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal showed Mr. Rubio trailing Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump received 41 percent, followed by Mr. Cruz at 22 percent, Mr. Rubio at 17 percent and Mr. Kasich at 13 percent. Despite this, some Michigan Republicans say that Mr. Kasich may emerge as the state's establishment choice. And in a race that has often felt like a reality television show, Mr. Kasich secured an apt endorsement on Sunday: that of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who will replace Mr. Trump as the host of ''The Celebrity Apprentice.''

41,The New York Times,7-Mar-16,Toronto's Counterattack Breaks Down the Red Bulls,Late Edition - Final,,,By FILIP BONDY,ENGLISH,,,UNITED STATES (70%),"Section D; Column 0; Sports Desk; TORONTO F.C. 2, RED BULLS 0; Pg. 6",,Newspaper,,,729 words,"PHOTOS: Toronto F.C. goalkeeper Clint Irwin and the Red Bulls' Felipe Martins, left. Toronto's Damien Perquis won a header over Martins, right. Toronto scored both of its goals after the 80th minute. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY NOAH K. MURRAY/USA TODAY SPORTS, VIA REUTERS  ADAM HUNGER/ASSOCIATED PRESS)",7-Mar-16,,,,REFEREES & UMPIRES (89%); SOCCER (78%); SPORTS (77%); SPORTS & RECREATION (77%); SPORTS AWARDS (64%); ATHLETES (50%),"HARRISON, N.J. --  Before a disheartening home opener Sunday, Red Bulls Coach Jesse Marsch had spoken about a possible Plan B for this season, if opponents adjusted too effectively to his club's high-press tactics. But when the Toronto F.C. midfield pinched the Red Bulls coming forward and set six to 10 men behind the ball, in and around the box, there were no effective answers. Marsch switched to three strikers, then back to two, to no avail. Half-chances were botched. The match devolved into a frustrating 2-0 defeat decided by two late, disastrous counters against the run of play. Clearly, after the Columbus Crew derailed his team in the playoffs last season with ambushes from the rear, Marsch can expect much more of the same this season -- a bogging down of the beautiful game from opposing teams. ''They tried to stop the game and slow it down at almost every point,'' Marsch griped. ''Goal kicks. Fouls. The slowing-down tactic has to be mitigated by officials. There were very few times Toronto pressed us and caused us trouble.'' On two counters, though, there was a great deal of trouble. Toronto's Sebastian Giovinco, who spent much of the match as a sneaky soloist downfield, scooted down the left side and found Tsubasa Endoh cutting into the box with a cross in the 81st minute. When Red Bulls defender Kemar Lawrence slid into the pass and took down the wing, the referee Allen Chapman took a moment before whistling for a foul and pointing to the penalty spot. ''We were both going, and I think he was going down before I slid in,'' Lawrence said, referring to Endoh. ''It went past a couple seconds, and the referee blew the whistle trying to make up his mind whether it was or was not a penalty.'' Regardless, Giovinco ripped the penalty kick past Luis Robles, low and to the left corner. Then, in the first minute of added time, Marco Delgado beat a stretched, desperate Red Bulls defense for a clean breakaway and finished an easy clincher past a helpless Robles. The roving Giovinco, M.L.S.'s most valuable player in 2015, had been a constant source of concern for the back line. ''They did a good job of staying compact, and we realized at that point they were just going to spring Giovinco,'' Robles said. ''We lacked the mental toughness to shut a player like that down.'' The defeat did nothing to alleviate early fears among fans that the rest of the league had caught on to the Red Bulls' frenetic tactics and that the team might need to mix things up considerably if it is to repeat the success of 2015. Last year, the Red Bulls won the Supporters' Shield with the best record in the league, only to be knocked out in the Eastern Conference finals by Columbus, which gummed up the works around the box and countered effectively. Toronto did not produce as many dangerous opportunities as Columbus did, but it did not need to, because the Red Bulls could not finish their own opportunities. ''We weren't very sharp,'' said Bradley Wright-Phillips, who missed a couple of chances. ''Our touches let us down. It's the first game. It's nothing to worry about.'' The Red Bulls did not lose a match last season until their eighth game and did not drop a home match until May 24. Marsch insisted, however, that his side would regain its form quickly. It is a familiar group. His lineup included 10 of the 11 players who started the last playoff game in November against Columbus, with the exception of Gideon Baah, who played at center back in place of Matt Miazga, who left the team for Chelsea. Baah played brilliantly, held his space and marked Giovinco effectively for most of the match. Still, the Red Bulls frayed near the end, and Marsch acknowledged that he might need to tweak his system and loosen things up a bit. ''We believe what we're doing,'' he said last week. ''That being said, there are ways to address what we're doing. Mixing it up, varying our formations a little, looking at rotations and matchups. We have more flexibility. I think it will be even harder to prepare for us. ''This year, you'll see greater variations,'' he added. A slight variation on a theme was not good enough on Sunday, when the Red Bulls were stymied on offense and then caught flat-footed twice in the final minutes. ''We got them in transitions,'' Toronto Coach Greg Vanney said. ''We knew that would be a big part of the game.''

Nancy Reagan, the influential and stylish wife of the 40th president of the United States who unabashedly put Ronald Reagan at the center of her life but became a political figure in her own right, died on Sunday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 94. The cause was congestive heart failure, according to a statement from Joanne Drake, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Reagan. Mrs. Reagan was a fierce guardian of her husband's image, sometimes at the expense of her own, and during Mr. Reagan's improbable climb from a Hollywood acting career to the governorship of California and ultimately the White House, she was a trusted adviser. ''Without Nancy, there would have been no Governor Reagan, no President Reagan,'' said Michael K. Deaver, a longtime aide and close friend of the Reagans who died in 2007. President Obama said on Sunday that Mrs. Reagan ''had redefined the role'' of first lady, adding, ''Later, in her long goodbye with President Reagan, she became a voice on behalf of millions of families going through the depleting, aching reality of Alzheimer's, and took on a new role, as advocate, on behalf of treatments that hold the potential and the promise to improve and save lives.'' Mrs. Reagan helped hire and fire the political consultants who ran her husband's near-miss campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 1976 and his successful campaign for the presidency in 1980. She also played a seminal role in the 1987 ouster of the White House chief of staff, Donald T. Regan, whom she blamed for ineptness after it was disclosed that Mr. Reagan had secretly approved arms sales to Iran. Behind the scenes, Mrs. Reagan was the prime mover in Mr. Reagan's efforts to recover from the scandal, which was known as Iran-contra because some of the proceeds from the sale had been diverted to the contras opposing the leftist government of Nicaragua. While trying to persuade her stubborn husband to apologize for the arms deal, Mrs. Reagan brought political figures into the White House, among them the Democratic power broker Robert S. Strauss, to argue her case to the president. Mr. Reagan eventually conceded that she was right. On March 4, 1987, the president made a distanced apology for the arms sale in a nationally televised address that significantly improved his slumping public approval ratings. His wife, typically, neither sought nor received credit for the turnaround. Mrs. Reagan did not wish to detract from her husband's luster by appearing to be a power behind the presidential throne. In public, she gazed at him adoringly and portrayed herself as a contented wife who had willingly given up a Hollywood acting career of her own to devote herself to her husband's career. ''He was all I had ever wanted in a man, and more,'' she wrote in ''My Turn: The Memoirs of Nancy Reagan,'' published in 1989. He reciprocated in kind. ''How do you describe coming into a warm room from out of the cold?'' he once said. ''Never waking up bored? The only thing wrong is, she's made a coward out of me. Whenever she's out of sight, I'm a worrier about her.'' In truth, she was the worrier. Mrs. Reagan wrote in her memoirs that she sometimes became angry with her husband because of his relentless optimism. He didn't worry at all, she wrote, ''and I seem to do the worrying for both of us.'' It was this conviction that led Mrs. Reagan to take a leading role in the Regan ouster and in other personnel matters in the White House. ''It's hard to envision Ronnie as being a bad guy,'' she said in a 1989 interview. ''And he's not. But there are times when somebody has to step in and say something. And I've had to do that sometimes -- often.'' She did not always get her way. Mr. Reagan ignored her criticism of several cabinet appointees, including Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger. In 2001, seven years after her husband announced that he had Alzheimer's disease, Mrs. Reagan broke with President George W. Bush and endorsed embryonic stem cell research. She stepped up her advocacy after her husband's death on June 5, 2004. ''She feels the greatest legacy her family could ever have is to spare other families from going through what they have,'' a family friend, Doug Wick, quoted Mrs. Reagan as saying. Years on Camera Born Anne Frances Robbins on July 6, 1921, in New York City, Nancy Davis was the daughter of Edith Luckett, an actress, and Kenneth Robbins, a car dealer who abandoned the family soon after her birth. Miss Luckett resumed her stage career when her daughter was 2 and sent the child to live with relatives in Bethesda, Md. In 1929, Mrs. Luckett married a Chicago neurosurgeon, Loyal Davis, who adopted Nancy and gave her the family name. Almost overnight, Nancy Davis's difficult childhood became stable and privileged. Throughout the rest of her life, she described Dr. Davis as her real father. Nancy Davis graduated from the elite Girls' Latin School in Chicago and then from Smith College in 1943. Slender, with photogenic beauty and large, luminous eyes, she considered an acting career. After doing summer stock in New England, she landed a part in the Broadway musical ''Lute Song,'' with Mary Martin and Yul Brynner. With the help of a friend, the actor Spencer Tracy, her mother then arranged a screen test given by the director George Cukor, of MGM. Cukor, according to his biographer, told the studio that Miss Davis lacked talent. Nonetheless, she was given a part in the film she had tested for, ''East Side, West Side,'' which was released in 1949 starring Barbara Stanwyck, James Mason and Ava Gardner. Cast as the socialite wife of a New York press baron, Miss Davis appeared in only two scenes, but they were with Miss Stanwyck, the film's top star. After her husband went into politics, Mrs. Reagan encouraged the notion that her acting interest had been secondary, a view underscored by the biographical information she supplied to MGM in 1949, in which she said her ''greatest ambition'' was to have a ''successful, happy marriage.'' But this was a convention in a day when women were not encouraged to have careers outside the home. In his book ''Reagan's America: Innocents at Home,'' Garry Wills disputed the prevalent view that Miss Davis had just been marking time in Hollywood while waiting for a man. She was ''the steady woman,'' he wrote, who in most of her 11 films had held her own with accomplished actors. The producer Dore Schary cast Miss Davis in her first lead role, in ''The Next Voice You Hear'' (1950), playing a pregnant mother opposite James Whitmore. She received good reviews for her work in ''Night Into Morning'' (1951), with Ray Milland, in which she played a war widow who talked Milland's character out of committing suicide. Mrs. Reagan thought this was her best film. Mr. Wills wrote that she was underrated as an actress because she had become most widely associated with her ''worst'' film, ''Hellcats of the Navy'' (1957), in which Ronald Reagan had the leading role. How They Met As she so often did in her life, Nancy Davis took the initiative in meeting the man who would become her husband. In the late 1940s, Hollywood was in the grip of a ''Red Scare,'' prompted by government investigations into accusations of Communist influence in the film industry. In October 1949, the name Nancy Davis appeared in a Hollywood newspaper on a list of signers of a supporting brief urging the Supreme Court to overturn the convictions of two screenwriters who had been blacklisted after being found guilty of contempt for refusing to cooperate with the House Un-American Activities Committee. Such newspaper mentions could mean the end of a career, and Miss Davis sought help from her friend Mervyn LeRoy, who had directed her in ''East Side, West Side.'' LeRoy found it was a case of mistaken identity: another Nancy Davis had worked in what he called ''leftist theater.'' He offered to call Ronald Reagan, president of the Screen Actors Guild, to make sure there would be no problems in the future. Instead, Miss Davis insisted that LeRoy set up a meeting with Mr. Reagan. The meeting took place over dinner at LaRue's, a fashionable Hollywood restaurant on Sunset Strip. Mr. Reagan, recovering from multiple leg fractures suffered in a charity baseball game, was on crutches. Miss Davis was immediately smitten. Mr. Reagan, though, was more cautious. According to Bob Colacello, who has written extensively about the Reagans, Mr. Reagan still hoped for a reconciliation with his first wife, the actress Jane Wyman, who had divorced him in 1948. After dating several times in the fall of 1949, Mr. Reagan and Miss Davis drifted apart and dated others. But they began seeing each other again in 1950. Miss Davis had been accepted on the board of the Screen Actors Guild, and she and Mr. Reagan began having dinner every Monday night after the meetings, often with the actor William Holden, the guild vice president, according to Mr. Colacello. Mr. Reagan and Nancy Davis were married on March 4, 1952, at a private ceremony at the Little Brown Church in the Valley, in Studio City. Mr. Holden and his wife, Ardis, were the only witnesses. After their marriage, the Reagans bought a house in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles, where their daughter, Patricia Ann, was born -- ''a bit precipitously,'' Mrs. Reagan wrote in her memoirs -- on Oct. 21, 1952. She is known as Patti Davis professionally. The Reagans also had a son, Ronald Prescott, on May 28, 1958. Besides her son and daughter, survivors include Mrs. Reagan's stepson, Michael Reagan, and her brother, Dr. Richard Davis. A stepdaughter, Maureen Reagan, died in 2001. At the time of their marriage, Mr. Reagan's film career was, as his new wife put it, at a ''standstill.'' Although Nancy Reagan had vowed not to be a working wife, she made a low-budget science-fiction movie, ''Donovan's Brain'' (1953), with Lew Ayres. Her working was ''a blow to Ronnie,'' Mrs. Reagan observed in her memoirs, ''but quite simply, we needed the money.'' The money worries ended early in 1954, when Music Corporation of America, the entertainment conglomerate, offered Mr. Reagan a television contract for $125,000 a year to be the host of ''General Electric Theater.'' It had a long run, broadcast on Sunday nights until 1962, and Mrs. Reagan herself acted in a few of its episodes. When her film career was over, she continued to work sporadically in television, in episodes of ''Zane Grey Theater,'' ''The Dick Powell Show'' and, as late as 1962, ''Wagon Train.'' A Loyal Supporter By then, Mr. Reagan had changed his partisan affiliation to Republican from Democratic and was giving political speeches. In Hollywood, Mr. Reagan's shift toward the right was often attributed to Mrs. Reagan and her father, Dr. Davis, a staunch conservative. Both the Reagans denied this; she was barely interested in politics at the time, they said. Ironically, when President Reagan began to negotiate with Soviet leaders, conservatives accused Mrs. Reagan of pushing him in a liberal direction. Evidence is lacking to support either suspicion. As Mrs. Reagan put it: ''If Ronnie hadn't wanted to do it, he wouldn't have done it.'' Though Mrs. Reagan was not at first keen on her husband's entry into politics, she loyally supported him. His career took off when he made a rousing nationally televised speech for the Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater on Oct. 27, 1964. The following year a group of wealthy people from Southern California approached Mr. Reagan about running for governor of California. He was interested. From the first, Mrs. Reagan was part of the campaign planning. ''They were a team,'' said Stuart Spencer, who with Bill Roberts managed the Reagan campaign. New to politics, she said little at first. But Mr. Spencer found her ''a quick learner, always absorbing.'' Before long she was peppering Mr. Roberts and Mr. Spencer about their strategy and tactics. Mr. Reagan won a contested Republican primary and then a landslide victory in November against the Democratic incumbent, Edmund G. Brown. For the Reagans, that meant a 350-mile move to the state capital, Sacramento. Mrs. Reagan was not happy there. She missed friends and the brisker social pace and milder climate of Southern California. And she hated the governor's mansion, a dilapidated Victorian house on a busy one-way street. So she persuaded her husband to lease, at their own expense, a 12-room Tudor house in a fashionable section of eastern Sacramento. Mr. Reagan's wealthy Southern California supporters later bought the house and leased it back to the Reagans. The mansion episode, and Mrs. Reagan's unalloyed preference for Southern California, aroused parochial resentment in Sacramento. She in turn disliked the city's locker-room political culture, which required her to socialize with the wives of legislators who had insulted her husband. She bristled at press scrutiny, which became more intense after Joan Didion and her husband, John Gregory Dunne, wrote an unflattering article, ''Pretty Nancy,'' in The Saturday Evening Post in 1968. The article described Mrs. Reagan's famous smile as a study in frozen insecurity. Mrs. Reagan, who thought she had made a good impression on Ms. Didion, was crushed by the article. Katharine Graham, the longtime publisher of The Washington Post and later a friend of Mrs. Reagan's, said the article set the tone for other unfavorable ones. But not all the press coverage was unflattering. A few months later, The Los Angeles Times published an article whose tone was telegraphed by its headline: ''Nancy Reagan: A Model First Lady.'' She also received positive publicity for welcoming home former prisoners of war from Vietnam and taking an active role in a Foster Grandparents Program for mentally disabled children. When President Richard M. Nixon became enmeshed in the Watergate scandal, the Reagans had already begun planning their next political move. In May 1974, they met with supporters at their home in Pacific Palisades. Among them was John P. Sears, a Washington lawyer who had worked for Mr. Nixon's presidential campaign in 1960. Mr. Sears, alone of those who attended the meeting, predicted the Nixon resignation. That made an impression on Mrs. Reagan. After Nixon resigned and was succeeded by Gerald R. Ford, Mr. Reagan began planning to challenge Mr. Ford for the 1976 Republican presidential nomination. Mrs. Reagan recommended hiring Mr. Sears to direct the effort, which Mr. Reagan narrowly lost. (Mr. Ford was then defeated by Jimmy Carter.) Four years later, as Mr. Reagan again sought the nomination, Mrs. Reagan played a leading role in the firing of Mr. Sears. The campaign had just won the New Hampshire primary, but Mrs. Reagan nevertheless came to believe that Mr. Sears was a disruptive influence. She also had a hand in the hiring of his replacement as campaign manager, William J. Casey, whom Mr. Reagan later named director of central intelligence. But after Mr. Reagan won the nomination and got off to a flustered start in his campaign against President Carter, Mrs. Reagan became critical of Mr. Casey and urged her husband to bring in Mr. Spencer, who had run Mr. Reagan's first campaign for governor. Mr. Spencer was persona non grata in the Reagan camp because he had managed Mr. Ford's campaign in 1976. But Mr. Reagan followed his wife's advice. Mr. Spencer joined the campaign and ran it smoothly. Not all of her advice was equally good. For instance, she opposed Mr. Spencer's proposal that her husband debate President Carter. Mr. Reagan decided to debate and did so well that he surged ahead in the polls and won convincingly a week later. A Sophisticated Turn As first lady, Mrs. Reagan was glamorous and controversial. The White House started serving liquor again after the abstemious Carter years. Mrs. Reagan reached out to Washington society. More sophisticated than she had been in Sacramento, Mrs. Reagan also reached out to politicians, Democrats as well as Republicans. She became friends with Millie O'Neal, wife of the House speaker, Thomas P. O'Neill, who was a political foe of President Reagan by day and a friend after hours. During one period in 1981, when Mrs. Reagan was getting ''bad press,'' as she recalled, Mr. O'Neill leaned across at a luncheon and said, ''Don't let it get you down.'' Mrs. Reagan's critics said she had brought the bad press on herself. After one look at the White House living quarters, Mrs. Reagan decided to redo them. She then raised $822,000 from private contributors to accomplish this. Another contributor put up more than $200,000 to buy a set of presidential china, enough for 220 place settings; it was the first new set in the White House since the Johnson administration. With a slim figure maintained by daily exercise, Mrs. Reagan looked younger than her years and wore expensively simple gowns provided by Galanos, Adolfo and other designers. One best-selling Washington postcard featured Mrs. Reagan in an ermine cape and jeweled crown with the label ''Queen Nancy.'' It touched a nerve with Mrs. Reagan, who had been surprised at the press criticism of the china purchase and the White House redecoration. But the rest of the country was kinder. In 1981, a Gallup poll put Mrs. Reagan first on the list of ''most admired women'' in the nation. She was in the top 10 on the list throughout the Reagan presidency. White House image-makers, aware that President Reagan was generally well liked for his self-deprecating humor, urged Mrs. Reagan to use humor as a weapon against her critics. She did so spectacularly on March 29, 1982, at the Gridiron Dinner, an annual roast by journalists, where, to standing ovations, she made sport of her stylish if icy image in a surprise on-stage appearance wearing feathered hat, pantaloons and yellow boots and singing ''Second Hand Clothes,'' a parody of the 1920s song ''Second Hand Rose.'' Mrs. Reagan's darkest memory was of March 30, 1981, when she received word that her husband had been shot by a would-be assassin outside the Washington Hilton Hotel. She rushed to the hospital, where her husband, although fighting for his life, was still wisecracking. ''Honey, I forgot to duck,'' he said to her, borrowing a line that the fighter Jack Dempsey supposedly said to his wife after losing the heavyweight championship to Gene Tunney in 1926. But Mrs. Reagan found nothing to laugh about. ''Nothing can happen to my Ronnie,'' she wrote in her diary that night. ''My life would be over.'' After the assassination attempt, Mrs. Reagan turned to Joan Quigley, a San Francisco astrologer, who claimed to have predicted that March 30 would be a ''bad day'' for the president. Her relationship with Ms. Quigley ''began as a crutch,'' Mrs. Reagan wrote, ''one of several ways I tried to alleviate my anxiety about Ronnie.'' Within a year, it was a habit. Mrs. Reagan conversed with Ms. Quigley by telephone and passed on the information she received about favorable and unfavorable days to Mr. Deaver, the presidential assistant, and later to the White House chief of staff, Donald Regan, for use in scheduling. Mr. Regan disclosed Mrs. Reagan's astrological bent in his 1988 book, ''For the Record: From Wall Street to Washington,'' asserting that the Quigley information created a chaotic situation for White House schedulers. Mrs. Reagan said that no political decisions had been made based on the astrologist's advice, nor did Mr. Regan allege that any had been. But the disclosure was nonetheless embarrassing to Mrs. Reagan; she and many commentators saw it as an act of revenge for the role she had played in forcing Mr. Regan out after the Iran-contra disclosures. Mrs. Reagan's low opinion of Mr. Regan was well known; she had said tartly that he ''liked the sound of chief but not of staff.'' In fact, however, Mr. Regan's resignation had also been demanded by powerful Republican figures, and the president had agreed to it. When Mr. Regan saw a report of this on CNN, he quit and walked out of the White House. Within the White House, Mrs. Reagan was known as a meticulous taskmaster. Some staff members feared incurring her disfavor. The speechwriter Peggy Noonan was wearing walking clothes in the White House the first time she passed by Mrs. Reagan, who looked at her with disdain. ''The next time I saw her I hid behind a pillar,'' Ms. Noonan wrote in the book ''What I Saw at the Revolution: A Political Life in the Reagan Era.'' Other staff members found Mrs. Reagan more approachable than her husband. One of these was the speechwriter Landon Parvin, who worked with Mrs. Reagan when she was engineering her husband's recovery from the Iran-contra scandal and drafted the apology in the president's televised speech. Her Own Causes As first lady, Mrs. Reagan traveled throughout the United States and abroad to speak out against drug and alcohol abuse by young Americans and coined the phrase ''Just Say No,'' which was used in advertising campaigns during the 1980s. In speeches about drug abuse, Mrs. Reagan often used a line from the William Inge play ''The Dark at the Top of the Stairs,'' in which a mother says of her children, ''I always thought I could give them life like a present, all wrapped in white with every promise of success.'' Mr. Parvin, in an interview, said she had become emotional when she read this line, ''as if it had a power that went back to her own childhood.'' On Oct. 17, 1987, a few days after cancer was detected in a mammogram, Mrs. Reagan underwent a mastectomy of her left breast. Afterward, she discussed the operation openly to encourage women to have mammograms every year. After the presidency, the Reagans returned to Los Angeles and settled in a ranch house in exclusive Bel Air. In 1994, Mr. Reagan learned he had Alzheimer's disease and announced the diagnosis to the American people in a poignant letter, which Mrs. Reagan had helped him write. For the next decade, Mrs. Reagan conducted what she called a ''long goodbye,'' described in Newsweek as ''10 years of exacting caregiving, hurried lunches with friends'' and ''hours spent with old love letters and powerful advocacy for new research into cures for the disease that was taking Ronnie from her.'' At Mr. Reagan's funeral, at the National Cathedral in Washington, she remained in tight control of her emotions. Then she flew west with the coffin for a burial service at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif., where Mrs. Reagan will also be buried. At the conclusion of the ceremony, at sunset, soldiers and sailors handed Mrs. Reagan a folded American flag. She held it close to her heart, put it down on the coffin, and at last began to cry.

43,The New York Times,7-Mar-16,Islanders Withstand Rally by Rangers and Gain Ground in the Playoff Race,Late Edition - Final,,,By ALLAN KREDA,ENGLISH,,,,"Section D; Column 0; Sports Desk; ISLANDERS 6, RANGERS 4; Pg. 4",,Newspaper,,,824 words,PHOTO: The Islanders' Cal Clutterbuck after a goal by Frans Nielsen (51).

By that point, the Islanders had already raced to a stunning 3-0 lead. With Henrik Lundqvist missing a second straight game, Raanta had spoken after the morning skate about not overthinking his temporary status as the Rangers' starting goaltender. But after the Islanders' early home-crowd-hushing barrage, Raanta had to be trying hard to cleanse his mind of just about everything. ''First period was the weirdest hockey period in my hockey life,'' Raanta said later. ''It felt like it was the coldest nightmare.'' Raanta did manage to steady himself, and the Rangers fought back to knot the score at 4-4 on a power-play goal by Derick Brassard 11 minutes 39 seconds into the third period. But the Islanders' Cal Clutterbuck took a pass from Casey Cizikas off a face-off and rifled home a goal with 1:28 to play, and Frans Nielsen added an empty-net goal 27 seconds later, icing a 6-4 win that left the Islanders (36-20-7) 3 points behind the Rangers (38-22-6) for second in the Metropolitan Division. The Islanders, who have won three straight against the Rangers this season, also have three games in hand. ''In a game like that, you can't really question the events that led up to the winning goal,'' said Clutterbuck, a gritty right wing, whose goal was his third winner this season. ''I caught it and flung it on net.'' Islanders defenseman Johnny Boychuk opened the scoring 2:50 into the game, with Brock Nelson scoring at 3:35 and then Kyle Okposo at 4:45. The Rangers did not even record a shot on goal until more than 10 minutes had elapsed But the game soon became equally precarious for Raanta's Islanders counterpart, Jaroslav Halak. At 11:16 of the first period, Oscar Lindberg poked in his first goal since Jan. 9, and the fourth-line left wing Tanner Glass tapped in a rebound at 11:54 to cut the Rangers' deficit to 3-2 and rouse the sleepy Garden crowd. ''We kind of came out a little flat, and they capitalized on some bounces,'' said Rangers center Derek Stepan, who lost the face-off against Cizikas that led to Clutterbuck's winner. ''Then we kind of did the same thing to them in the second half of the first period. I think we responded really well after being down, 3-0.'' As the fans were trying to process the offensive frenzy, Boychuk scored again at 13:14 on a long shot from the right point -- the first time in his career he had scored twice in a game. Raanta -- perhaps wondering if he might be pulled in favor of the rookie Magnus Hellberg, recalled from Hartford -- again hunched up as the Islanders celebrated. Raanta stayed in, though, and Eric Staal, playing in his fourth game since being traded last week, scored his first goal as a Ranger at 13:45 as the frenetic opening period continued. The Islanders' Nick Leddy hit the post, and Rangers forward Dominic Moore did the same at the other end of the ice. The scoring finally ceased, however, and the period concluded with the Islanders leading, 4-3. Islanders Coach Jack Capuano said he was happy with his team's strong play early in the first period. ''They didn't have a sniff,'' he said of the Rangers. The fast start helped the Islanders survive a scoreless second period in which the Rangers held an 11-7 shooting advantage and a third period featuring tight defense and steady goaltending. The victory was the Islanders' sixth from a season-high seven-game trip, giving them momentum ahead of a home game Tuesday against the Pittsburgh Penguins, who downed the Devils, 6-1, to remain 3 points behind the Islanders in the division race. Raanta had won his previous three starts for the Rangers but was facing the Islanders for the first time in his career. Heading into the game, he seemed only to want to keep a level head. ''I've been working hard in practice when I haven't been playing,'' Raanta, acquired from Chicago in June to back up Lundqvist, said after the morning skate. ''Now it's time for those things to pay off a little bit, and be ready for some games in a row.'' Raanta, 26, got the opportunity because Lundqvist, who collided with his teammate Ryan McDonagh during Thursday's loss at Pittsburgh, remained out with what Rangers Coach Alain Vigneault described as continuing neck spasms. ''His movements aren't fully fluid,'' Vigneault said of Lundqvist, who skated on Sunday morning before the team skate and was listed as day-to-day. The Islanders might have preferred facing Raanta, but Capuano, with prescience, said before the game, ''It's always a track meet playing these guys.'' Capuano added, ''We have to just work and play a simple game.'' It did not quite work out that way, but the 2 points the Islanders picked up could prove key as the postseason looms, and with it another possible clash between the New York teams.

In it, Mr. Pugh, wrote of his plan to become a martyr. ''I will escort you into Paradise and when you see the home paid for by my blood and your tears you will know it was worth it,'' reads the letter, typed on his computer in January 2015. In it, he pledged to ''use the talents and skills given to me by Allah to establish and defend the Islamic State.'' Days after writing those words, Mr. Pugh boarded a plane for Istanbul. Prosecutors say he was on his way to neighboring Syria to present himself to the Islamic State. But Mr. Pugh never got that far. He was detained upon landing in Istanbul and deported to New York, where the Federal Bureau of Investigation was waiting. Last week, he became one of the first American citizens to stand trial on Islamic State-related charges. The testimony in Federal District Court in Brooklyn has shown Mr. Pugh to be a skilled airplane mechanic and a convert to Islam who drifted across the Middle East, finding work at small airlines flying in and out of military bases on Pentagon contracts. But Mr. Pugh's increasingly radical views had begun to alienate his co-workers and supervisors. One of his managers, Aamer Aslam, now a pilot for United Airlines, testified last week that Mr. Pugh had once claimed that the Islamic State was seeking skilled airplane mechanics. This seemed to hint at Mr. Pugh's own desire to join the Islamic State. The January letter to his wife, Misha, however, is the clearest declaration of any intentions to join the militant group. It is the perfect piece of incriminating evidence, except for one thing: Mr. Pugh does not seem to have actually sent the letter. It appeared to be just a draft, raising the question of why he never sent it. Did the letter explain his intentions at the time he flew to Istanbul? Did he avoid sending it because he and his wife had previously argued about jihad? His lawyers have claimed that while Mr. Pugh had dark internal fantasies about jihad, his purpose in flying to Istanbul was only to relax and search for a new job. The draft letter perfectly captures the larger question that the jury will have to consider this week as it decides Mr. Pugh's fate: where (and how) to mark the precise moment when a man's fantasies become plans and his planning crosses over into concrete action. It is a question that courts and juries are likely to be grappling with in similar cases in the years to come. Since 2013, the Justice Department has charged at least 85 people in cases related to foreign terrorist groups or homegrown violent extremism. Some three-quarters of these cases are connected to the Islamic State, a Justice Department spokesman, Marc Raimondi, said. Terrorism and national security cases traditionally featured clandestine meetings of secret cells and oaths of loyalty. By contrast, the Islamic State has drawn in recruits from afar, in part by bombarding the world with propaganda and scenes of carnage, available to anyone with an Internet connection. Mr. Pugh's trial is presenting an early case study of how juries will sort through the Islamic State propaganda, online messages and travel itineraries that are likely to account for much of the evidence in such cases. Over several days last week, the jury listened to testimony on topics ranging from Mr. Pugh's Internet searches and the propaganda he viewed (which included scenes of beheadings and crucifixions under the Islamic State), to the type of clothing Mr. Pugh packed in his backpack (''all-terrain sandals,'' an F.B.I. agent testified about his footwear), as the prosecution made its case that Mr. Pugh was destined for Syria. For the prosecution, by the time Mr. Pugh flew to Turkey -- a common entrance point to Syria for foreign fighters -- he had taken steps to join the Islamic State, committing a federal crime: attempting to support a foreign terrorist organization. Evidence from his computer showed that he had researched the most common border crossings between Turkey and Syria. But defense lawyers pointed out that he was also searching websites for a new aviation job in the region after being fired from one in Kuwait. And some of his last Internet searches, on TripAdvisor, were for Turkish baths in Istanbul, a detail that is turning into the cornerstone of his defense. At the outset of the trial, one of his lawyers, Eric M. Creizman, even claimed that Mr. Pugh went to Istanbul ''to clear his head,'' as though the heat of the bathhouses might have cleansed him of his jihadist fantasies. As each side sought to convince jurors of what Mr. Pugh intended to do upon landing in Istanbul, the contents of his two backpacks loomed large. Some items seemed to support the prosecution's claim that Mr. Pugh was Syria-bound: a black ski mask, a small solar-powered cellphone charger and two compasses. But there were alternative interpretations as well: Istanbul was bitterly cold when Mr. Pugh landed; a solar-powered cellphone charger might be useful to an itinerant airplane mechanic; and compasses could help a Muslim in an unfamiliar city orient himself toward Mecca during prayer. Mr. Pugh is not expected to testify, his lawyers have said. Yet the jury has caught snippets of his innermost thoughts, from his Google searches to his efforts to communicate with his wife, an Egyptian woman who spoke little English, while Mr. Pugh spoke no Arabic. Apart for long periods, they corresponded by recruiting strangers on Facebook to translate their messages between English and Arabic, a laborious process that produced as much frustration as understanding. At one point, they apparently argued about Mr. Pugh's visions of martyrdom and she had brought up divorce, according to Facebook messages. ''I am on a mission for the pleasure of Allah,'' Mr. Pugh wrote in one message, less than four months before he left for Istanbul. ''I delayed for 2 years because of your selfish behavior. I will not allow you or anyone to get in my way.''  URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/nyregion/trial-of-veteran-accused-of-trying-to -join-isis-may-hinge-on-unsent-letter.html"
46,The New York Times,7-Mar-16,"For Trump, Broadway Held Sway",Late Edition - Final,,"NEW YORK, NY, USA (79%)",By MICHAEL PAULSON,ENGLISH,,,UNITED STATES (79%),Section C; Column 0; The Arts/Cultural Desk; Pg. 1,"NEW YORK, USA (79%)",Newspaper,,DONALD TRUMP (93%),1212 words,"PHOTOS: Above left, Donald J. Trump and his father, Fred, in Queens in 1973 and, above right, a Playbill for ''Paris Is Out!'' With some money from his father, Mr. Trump helped finance that play, which began performances on Broadway in 1970 and was a flop.

(PHOTOGRAPHS BY SY FRIEDMAN",7-Mar-16,,,,THEATER (90%); CARD GAMES (73%); BIOGRAPHICAL LITERATURE (64%); PROFILES & BIOGRAPHIES (50%),"The Broadway producer David Black was sitting in his office, above the Palace Theater, when a young Donald J. Trump walked in, unannounced, and asked him to lunch. Mr. Trump was just 23 years old, fresh out of Wharton, with some money from his developer-father and an interest in what it might be like to be a Broadway producer. He took Mr. Black to the private Metropolitan Club, peppered him with questions about the ins and outs of the theater business, and made an offer: Mr. Trump would pay half the cost of putting up Mr. Black's next play if the producer would give him equal billing on the posters and in Playbill. When ''Paris Is Out!,'' a domestic comedy featuring Molly Picon, a well-known star of the Yiddish theater, began performances on Broadway early in 1970, Mr. Trump's name was above the title, with that of Mr. Black. The show was a flop, and its closing brought an abrupt end to Mr. Trump's career as a Broadway producer. But his approach to producing -- at one point he questioned why the show's poster wasn't more prominently displayed outside a Times Square ticket office -- foreshadowed his approach to other businesses. And, although ''Paris Is Out!'' remains Mr. Trump's only Broadway credit, his off-and-on flirtation with the theater world, which included abortive talks about musicals inspired by his career, add some drama to the biography of the man who has unexpectedly become the leading contender for the Republican nomination for president. Throughout his interactions with the theater business, he has shown more of an interest in finances than dramaturgy, an instinct for self-promotion, a sense of his own name as a brand, and a willingness to deploy his growing celebrity for a variety of purposes. By the time Mr. Trump showed up at Mr. Black's door, he had read about the play and Mr. Black. He wanted to know how Mr. Black had found the play, and how long it would have to run to break even. ''He had done his homework, and that was unusual,'' Mr. Black recalled. ''Most of the people who put up money for shows just wanted to meet girls and go to parties, but he wasn't like that.'' The show was capitalized at $140,000, so Mr. Trump put up $70,000. He agreed that Mr. Black, as the lead producer, would make all decisions. The creative team does not recall any input from him; he did, however, have ideas on the money side. ''He wanted to know why we had to pay two men to pull the curtain up and down when they played pinochle the rest of the day,'' Mr. Black recalled. ''And at one point he came in and said, 'Our poster is behind one of the other posters.''' Richard Seff, who wrote ''Paris Is Out!,'' remembers twice saying hello to Mr. Trump when he was standing in the back of the orchestra, observing. ''He would just drop in,'' said Mr. Seff, who is now a theater critic for DC Metro Theater Arts. ''He was a young heir apparent, beginning his life with his father's business, who used to drive up to the theater in his white convertible.'' ''Paris Is Out!,'' which starred Sam Levene, a veteran film and stage actor, alongside Ms. Picon, had its admirers during an earlier production in Paramus, N.J. But the producers were so worried about critical reaction that they held no press performances, and with good reason -- the critics were unimpressed. In The New York Times, Clive Barnes wrote, ''I pitied it more than I disliked it,'' but called it ''a bad play.'' After 112 performances, facing weak ticket sales, Mr. Black closed the show. Mr. Trump, a professed Broadway fan and a regular at opening nights, had several subsequent discussions about a return to the theater business. In 1992, Marla Maples, who was then his girlfriend and is now his ex-wife, stepped into the cast of ''The Will Rogers Follies'' as a character named Ziegfeld's Favorite. The move brought a flurry of media attention and boosted ticket sales for the show. The publicity prompted the show's producer, Pierre Cossette, to tell New York Magazine in 1992 that he was talking with Mr. Trump about making a musical about his life. ''Trump is a natural because he's a bigger-than-life person,'' Mr. Cossette explained. That idea went nowhere. But Mr. Trump became a reality television star with the success of ''The Apprentice,'' and in 2005 he announced that the TV show would be adapted as a Broadway musical. Barry Weissler, a Broadway producer who had once floated the idea that Mr. Trump play the role of Billy Flynn in ''Chicago,'' was to co-produce with television's Mark Burnett. ''We worked on it, but it didn't have enough twists and turns and tension -- it couldn't rise above what they were doing on television,'' Mr. Weissler said. ''Eventually it just faded away.'' There was another round of discussions about a Trump-related Broadway show in the summer of 2007, when Mr. Trump met in his office with a creative team to talk about producing a revue, using songs from the Irving Berlin catalog, with ''The Trump Follies'' as the working title. In the show, which was to be written by Jonathan Tolins and Robert Cary and directed by John Rando, a young bellhop would work his way up through a hotel, observing different dance rehearsals as he rose, as he sought to visit a Trump-like producer on the top floor. Mr. Trump impressed the creative team. ''He was smart and funny and pretty charming, but the show fell apart, like most shows do,'' Mr. Tolins said. Anna Louizos, the team's scenic designer, said Mr. Trump ''seemed open to the idea, but then it just fizzled out.'' Mr. Trump declined a request for an interview, but his spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said: ''Mr. Trump has always enjoyed Broadway. A couple of years ago he looked into the possibility of a show called 'Trump,' but he was just too busy with so many other things.'' Yet over the years, Mr. Trump has found numerous ways to stay connected to theater. In 1995 he recorded a fake poetry slam promotional video for use in ''The Monogamist'' at Playwrights Horizons. (''Only people who had senses of humor about themselves would let me, a little Off Broadway director, into their offices,'' recalled the play's director, Scott Elliott. ''He was very willing to go on camera, and he seemed to like the comedy. And it was a bit that audiences found hilarious.'') In 1996 he made a cameo appearance as an Internal Revenue Service agent in the opening-night concert performance of ''Du Barry Was a Lady'' in City Center's Encores series. And in 2010, ''The Apprentice'' had an episode on which the actress Kristin Chenoweth, among others, helped Mr. Trump judge aspiring Broadway producers. Mr. Black, the producer of ''Paris Is Out!'', is now 84, and still muses about how things might have worked out differently. ''He did have a flair for show business, and he liked putting his name on something that was not real estate,'' Mr. Black recalled. ''And, if the play had been a hit, who knows, he might have continued.'' Mr. Black recalls the day he had to inform Mr. Trump that ''Paris Is Out!'' would close. The two men went to a coffee shop just off Eighth Avenue, where Mr. Black broke the news. ''When I told him I had to close it, he said, 'David, what should I do now?''' Mr. Black recalled. ''I said, 'Why don't you try real estate?'''  URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/theater/for-a-young-donald-j-trump-broadway-he ld-sway.html"

The Jin Teng, which is suspected of being a North Korean ship, arrived Thursday at Subic Bay, a commercial port about 50 miles northwest of Manila. It will be impounded, its crew will be deported, and it will most likely be inspected by a team from the United Nations, said Charles Jose, a spokesman for the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs. The vessel is registered and flagged under multiple countries, but it is one of 31 listed as being owned by North Korea, Philippine officials said, and therefore subject to seizure under the new sanctions. The sanctions are a result of a United Nations Security Council resolution that was passed Wednesday after a North Korean nuclear test on Jan. 6 and a long-range rocket test on Feb. 7. One component of the new sanctions requires countries to inspect all cargo passing through their territory en route to or from North Korea. Inspections previously had been required only if there was reasonable suspicion of contraband aboard. ''The world is concerned over North Korea's nuclear weapons program, and as a member of the U.N., the Philippines has to do its part to enforce the sanctions,'' Manuel L. Quezon III, a member of the president's communications team, said on a government-run radio station on Saturday. The 4,355-ton vessel had a crew of 21 North Korean citizens and was in the Philippines to unload a shipment of agricultural byproducts often used as livestock feed. The Philippine Coast Guard searched the vessel on Friday and found no prohibited items. Only minor safety violations, including missing fire hoses and exposed wiring, were discovered. The vessel's last port of call was in Indonesia, and it was going to proceed to Zhanjiang Port in China after unloading in Subic Bay, Philippine Coast Guard officials said Saturday. It was not scheduled to pick up any cargo in the Philippines. In 2008, the police seized about 1,500 pounds of crystal methamphetamine, with an estimated value of more than $100 million, in Subic Bay that drug enforcement officials at the time said had been produced in North Korea.

The backup goaltender Matt Murray made 17 saves as the Penguins rebounded from a dismal performance against the Calgary Flames 24 hours earlier. Kyle Palmieri scored his 25th goal of the season for the Devils, who played without the injured All-Star goaltender Cory Schneider, who had limited Pittsburgh to six goals in the last six meetings. Keith Kinkaid made 24 saves. The win was the Penguins' fourth in six games, and it moved them into seventh place in the Eastern Conference, 1 point ahead of Detroit. The loss was the eighth in 10 games for the Devils.

(PHOTOGRAPH BY PAULA LOBO FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)",7-Mar-16,,,,DANCERS (90%); DANCE (90%); CHOREOGRAPHY (90%); ARTISTS & PERFORMERS (89%),"After 35 years at the helm of her company, the choreographer Elisa Monte, who began her career as a dancer with Agnes de Mille and Martha Graham, is stepping down. Her troupe's season at Aaron Davis Hall, which closed on Saturday, warmly ushered in a new artistic director, Tiffany Rea-Fisher, who joined Elisa Monte Dance in 2004. Saturday's program focused on Ms. Rea-Fisher's choreography -- until the final act, a performance of Ms. Monte's ''Shattered'' (2000) by alumni of the company. And then there was the surprise coda, a lengthy excerpt from ''Pangaea'' (2016), Ms. Monte's latest work. Pushing the evening to two long hours, the addendum read as an ardent farewell to her fans while suggesting an unwillingness to let go. Ms. Rae-Fisher's aesthetic doesn't stray far from Ms. Monte's, especially in its high-strung mode of emotional expression. In two solos -- ''why so curious?'' (2015) and ''Current'' (new this season) -- as well as a new ensemble work, ''Newton's Cradle,'' her dancers performed states of confusion and longing, grappling with obstacles we couldn't see. In both Ms. Monte's work and Ms. Rae-Fisher's, the motivation for these feelings often remains unclear -- as though we should just accept their intense grasp on the performers -- a mystery more frustrating than it is alluring. That frustration stems in part from witnessing the dancers' technical excellence. How nice it would be to watch them move without the weight of so much false theatricality. In ''why so curious?'' the fast and furious Thomas Varvaro, in a formal vest and black briefs, seemed to be at once looking for and running from something, as he slid across the floor on the tip of one toe or furtively glanced behind him while lifting one leg to his head. Miles Mosley's restless score compounded the sense of urgency but didn't illuminate the source. A similar scenario unfolded in ''Current,'' in which the vibrant Alrick Thomas moved as if propelled -- sometimes paralyzed -- by a strand of electric shocks. ''Newton's Cradle,'' inspired by the physics of the titular device, offered quieter moments among its 11 dancers, in particular the company's women, led by the sultry Clymene Baugher. Ms. Rae-Fisher seems as energized by large groups as Ms. Monte, whose ''Pangaea'' coalesced around gnarled lifts involving all eight dancers. The simulated thunderstorm of ''Shattered,'' though, would have made a more fitting finale. It was kind of a mess, but the alumni, Ms. Rea-Fisher among them, gave their all for Ms. Monte.

Like many other big food companies, Mondelez has struggled to increase volume sales of its products as smaller, newer competitors win consumers' affections. Higher prices helped its so-called organic revenues -- sales generated solely by operations and not mergers or acquisitions -- grow 4.7 percent in the fourth quarter of last year. But volume sales, the actual amount of products sold, dropped 3.1 percent. In particular, sales of chocolate, which account for almost a third of Mondelez's business, have been harmed by price increases, making the company's snack and biscuit businesses more important. To develop Good Thins, Mondelez talked to consumers about what they wanted in a snack, Ms. Brown said. Consumers told Mondelez they did not want things like artificial colors and flavors, cholesterol or high-fructose corn syrup in their snacks. But they wanted good taste and texture, characteristics that often rely on those unwanted ingredients. ''Five years ago, you found products without all those things on the shelf, but they didn't really taste great,'' Ms. Brown said. ''People were willing to accept that then -- but they aren't now.'' Snacking is a $6.2 billion business and growing. The Hartman Group, a consumer research firm, estimates that snacking accounts for about half of all eating occasions, replacing breakfast and lunch in particular, and says that 90 percent of consumers report snacking multiple times during the day. ''Snacking is the hottest topic we have right now -- all our clients want to know about it,'' said Melissa Abbott, vice president for culinary insights at Hartman. ''Snacks used to be a once-a-day treat, but consumers now think snacking is healthier than sitting down to three meals a day, in part because more snacks are being made with wholesome ingredients and less processing.'' For food businesses, snacks tend to offer higher margins, although more sophisticated snacks, studded with nuts, seeds and dried fruits and drizzled with honey or chocolate, contain more expensive ingredients, too. But companies still see room in the market for new snack products. Abbott Laboratories, which makes medical devices and equipment as well as baby formulas and nutrition drinks, recently introduced a line of snack bars called Curate, with flavor combinations like fig and balsamic vinegar, and apricot and Marcona almond. And Quaker, a unit of PepsiCo, is introducing Quaker Breakfast Flats, bars aimed at what the company calls a ''new eating occasion,'' the midmorning snack.

52,The New York Times,7-Mar-16,Pushing the Boundaries of Free Speech in Cuba,Late Edition - Final,,"HAVANA, CUBA (79%)",By ERNESTO LONDOÑO,ENGLISH,Editorial,,CUBA (99%); UNITED STATES (93%),Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL NOTEBOOK; Pg. 20,,Newspaper,,FIDEL CASTRO (58%); BARACK OBAMA (50%),551 words,,7-Mar-16,,,,SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS (90%); BASEBALL (90%); EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (90%); SPORTS (90%); FREEDOM OF SPEECH (89%); US-CUBA DIPLOMATIC RELATIONSHIP (78%); SPORTS & RECREATION (78%); PUBLIC HEARINGS (76%); WRITERS (75%); POLITICS (75%); TALKS & MEETINGS (72%); US PRESIDENTS (71%); POLITICAL PARTIES (70%); GAYS & LESBIANS (64%); BLOGS & MESSAGE BOARDS (62%); LGBT RIGHTS (50%),"In the past, when a Cuban athlete vanished during a sporting event abroad, news about the defection would spread by word of mouth back home. There would be no official acknowledgment or mention in the state-run press. Not so with the recent defection of star baseball players and brothers Yulieski Gourriel and Lourdes Gourriel Jr. -- an episode that illustrates how citizens in the most repressive country in the hemisphere are increasingly pushing the boundaries of free speech. The Communist Party's newspaper, Granma, published a brief article on Feb. 8 criticizing the brothers for ''surrendering to the mercenaries'' of for-profit professional baseball. Then, something remarkable happened. Regional newspapers, which are also state-run, published pieces that provided a detailed account of the escape and dared to lament the dismal state of the country's revered baseball league. ''Cuban baseball has reached a point where the only things that create a stir are defections, brawls and abrupt resignations,'' a writer charged in an opinion article published late last month in the newspaper Vanguardia. It was not an isolated case. Since the United States started normalizing relations with Havana in late 2014, Cubans have begun to debate once-taboo subjects and criticize their government more boldly. American critics of the Obama administration's rapprochement with Cuba have called the shift in policy a failure by focusing on how rigid the socialist government has remained. They're missing something important: The new relationship has done much to diminish the culture of fear and obedience the state has long used to control its citizens. For years, those who criticized the government paid a high price and were branded as traitors, but today Cubans from a broader cross-section of society are speaking out with less fear. A youth group led by bloggers recently began a round of town hall meetings at universities around the country to debate the political future of an island that has been ruled by two autocratic brothers since 1959 and the continuing exodus of young people. Harold Cárdenas, one of the leaders of the group, known as Young Cuba, recently lamented the lack of political enthusiasm among his contemporaries. ''Has Cuban youth become apolitical?'' he wrote in a post. ''Or is it that the current alternatives are unappealing? That is a veiled but sharp criticism of Cuba's graying and increasingly unseen leaders by Mr. Cárdenas, who has close ties to the progressive wing of the government. Taking that sort of euphemistic shot at the state in Cuba is not so unusual, but some Cubans have gone even further. Last October, the state-run newspaper Tribuna published an article that mockingly made allusions to the extravagant trips Antonio Castro, the son of former President Fidel Castro, took to Turkey and the United States. Last year, gay rights advocates demanded in an article published in a blog on Cuba's state-run blog platform that the current president apologize for the abusive treatment of gay men during the early years of the Cuban revolution. The government's only response was to censor the blog post, which nonetheless was shared widely.

Now Republicans in the House are doing much the same thing. Initially convened in response to the videos, the Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives, a part of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, pledges to ''get the facts about medical practices of abortion service providers and the business practices of the procurement organizations who sell baby body parts.'' Its first hearing last Wednesday was a showcase for fallacious attacks on fetal tissue research. In her opening statement, Representative Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican who heads the panel, talked about the Tuskegee syphilis experiment and the forced sterilization of people with intellectual disabilities as a prelude to discussing fetal tissue research. She went on to claim that the Center for Medical Progress's videos showed ''something very troubling is going on related to fetal tissue and research,'' even though multiple investigations of Planned Parenthood have found no evidence of wrongdoing. The panel, dominated by Republicans, decided to issue subpoenas requesting the names of medical researchers who work with fetal tissue and employees at a clinic that provides abortions. That tactic could put clinic workers, who routinely face harassment and threats, at greater risk by making their names public as part of a congressional investigation. As Representative Jan Schakowsky, the ranking Democrat on the panel, put it, ''Linking individuals' names to an investigation that the Republicans describe as examining the 'harvesting of baby body parts' and the 'horrific practices' of abortion providers puts people in danger.'' Some witnesses called by the Republicans questioned the research value of fetal tissue or said it could be replaced by tissue from other sources. But many medical experts say fetal tissue research is a necessary part of the search for treatments for Parkinson's, diabetes and other conditions. At the hearing, Lawrence Goldstein, the director of the stem cell program at the University of California, San Diego, said that stopping fetal tissue research would slow the search for a vaccine for the Zika virus. Fetal tissue has already been used to produce vaccines for diseases like polio and rubella, and a panel convened by President Ronald Reagan found fetal tissue donation and research to be ethically acceptable. The panel's efforts will not be limited to blocking fetal tissue research, which is bad enough. According to its website, it is empowered to study federal funding for abortion providers, late-term abortion practices and ''any changes in law or regulation necessary as a result of any other findings made.'' Wednesday's hearing showed that limiting or ending access to legal abortion services is part of the agenda. One witness said that women who have had abortions ''forfeit the moral standing needed'' to decide what should happen to the fetal tissue. One panel member, Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee, bizarrely asked, ''Have we reached a point in our society where there effectively is an Amazon.com for human parts, including entire babies?'' -- a comment that has no basis in reality. Since the panel's goals are so broad, its future direction is unclear. What is clear is that by pursuing their baseless investigation into ''baby body parts,'' Republicans are continuing the campaign against fetal tissue research and reproductive rights that the Center for Medical Progress began.

54,The New York Times,7-Mar-16,Leaving the E.U. Would Hurt Britain,Late Edition - Final,,"LONDON, ENGLAND (79%)",By THE EDITORIAL BOARD,ENGLISH,Editorial,,UNITED KINGDOM (94%); EUROPE (94%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (93%); UNITED STATES (92%); GERMANY (79%); NORWAY (79%); NETHERLANDS (58%),Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 20,,Newspaper,,,635 words,DRAWING (DRAWING BY ALEX NABAUM),7-Mar-16,,EUROPEAN UNION (84%); ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION & DEVELOPMENT (55%),,INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (92%); EUROPEAN UNION (90%); EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (90%); TRADE TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (89%); INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW (89%); AGREEMENTS (87%); TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (86%); GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (78%); ECONOMIC NEWS (78%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (77%); LIVING STANDARDS (76%); INTERGOVERNMENTAL TALKS (76%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (73%); ECONOMIC POLICY (72%); TRADE DEVELOPMENT (72%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (71%); CURRENCIES (68%); RESEARCH REPORTS (65%); GREENHOUSE GASES (50%),"Would Britain be better off economically outside the European Union? The answer is most likely no, which is why Britons need to weigh the evidence carefully when they go to the polls in June to vote on leaving the E.U. Proponents of an exit criticize the union for taking too much power away from member nations and for issuing unnecessary and excessive regulations. This, the argument goes, has hurt Britain's economy. But the data does not back that up. It is far from clear that leaving would lead to faster growth and better living standards. In fact, it could have the opposite effect. If E.U. regulations were as onerous as British critics say, those rules would hurt all 28 member countries. Yet the economies of other members like Germany, the Netherlands and Ireland have been more productive than Britain. Those countries had a gross domestic product per hour worked that was nearly the same as the United States in 2014, while Britain's comparable figure was much lower, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. If Britain left the E.U. it would have to replace the union's rules with its own regulations in areas like the environment, banking and social services. It is improbable that when it came down to specific rules, the British public would want the risks that come with a more laissez-faire approach. In some areas like policies to reduce greenhouse gases, British regulations are already tougher than those of the E.U., according to an analysis by Open Europe, a London-based research group. Supporters of an exit argue that Britain would be able to maintain an open market with the union, its biggest trading partner. But that seems like wishful thinking. The E.U. would have no obligation to continue giving Britain tariff-free access to its market without securing big concessions in return. For example, Norway, which is not a member, pays the E.U. a fee and abides by most of its regulations to get access to its market. As far as trading with the rest of the world, Britain would most likely be worse off on its own. The European Union has trade agreements with countries that account for 60 percent of Britain's trade, according to Open Europe. Britain would probably have to negotiate new pacts with those countries, and the terms would very likely be less favorable than those secured by the E.U. The union, after all, is the world's largest economy with a G.D.P. of $18.5 trillion in 2014; Britain's G.D.P. was $3 trillion. For the United States, which is negotiating a trade agreement with the E.U., a pact with Britain would no doubt be a lower priority. Investors are clearly worried about Britain's economic prospects if it leaves, which is why the pound has depreciated against the dollar in recent months. One pound was $1.42 on Friday, down from $1.53 six months earlier. Global businesses with a big presence in Britain are particularly concerned. An exit could prompt banks and large corporations to move parts of their operations from London to other European cities so they could continue doing business in E.U. countries without any disruptions. Supporters of an exit say British taxpayers would save about 10 billion pounds ($13.9 billion) a year if they no longer had to contribute to the E.U. budget. That is overstated, because Britain would have to spend more on the government functions that are now handled by the E.U. Besides, that sum amounts to just 1.3 percent of the government's total budgeted spending for its current fiscal year. Ultimately, separating from the union is highly unlikely to yield the economic bounty supporters have promised and it would leave Britain more isolated and probably poorer.

More than one million migrants arrived in Europe last year, and the prospect of another large influx threatens to overwhelm Greece and destroy a policy of open borders across much of the Continent. The dangers faced by migrants who take sea routes to Greece were underscored again on Sunday when at least 18 people drowned off the Turkish coast, according to news reports. More than 300 migrants have already died this year making similar journeys on that route. As part of efforts to quell the mounting crisis, Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of NATO, said Sunday that ships used by the alliance would begin conducting operations in the territorial waters of Greece and Turkey after ''close consultation and coordination'' with the two countries. NATO's patrols in the Aegean would focus on ''collecting information and conducting monitoring,'' Mr. Stoltenberg said. The idea, he added, is to ''share information in real time,'' including between Greece and Turkey, and to enable them and Frontex, the European Union's border agency, to ''take action in real time'' against the smuggling rackets. He did not offer specific examples of how smugglers might be stopped. Last month, Mr. Stoltenberg said NATO forces would ''not turn back the boats.'' But, he added, if NATO vessels did ''encounter people in distress at sea,'' the crews would live up to their ''responsibility to assist.'' European Union leaders, such as Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, want to persuade Turkey to reduce the number of migrants leaving its shores and to take back large numbers of people who have already crossed the Aegean but are not eligible for political asylum in Europe. In exchange, European countries would offer to directly resettle a large number of refugees living in camps in Turkey who have fled the violence in Syria. In addition, the European Union could eventually add to the $3.3 billion it pledged to Turkish aid organizations in November. That money was intended to help manage millions of refugees and migrants in Turkey. European Union leaders had raised hopes that such a trade-off with the Turkish prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, could be negotiated at the meeting in Brussels on Monday. They have said, however, that it remains too early for an agreement on the number of people who would be transferred from Europe back to Turkey. Another factor that could impede progress at the meeting is a ruling by a Turkish court ordering the seizure of the opposition Zaman newspaper. That move has prompted sharp criticism from some European Union parliamentarians who say Europe relies too heavily on Turkey to ease the migration crisis. They say it should instead make a unified effort to help Greece and create an effective coast guard to protect the bloc's coastlines. In Greece, a nation still grappling with severe economic problems, many thousands of migrants have become trapped because Macedonia, which is not a member of the European Union, has blocked their passage northward. On Sunday, Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats group in the European Parliament, said Turkey had so far given little more than ''empty promises'' on returning migrants. He also warned against making a deal with ''a country that imprisons journalists, attacks civil liberties and with a highly worrying human rights situation.'' As Europe continues to dither over the worst crisis of its kind since the Second World War, the announcement that NATO would expand its operations could, at least, give leaders more time to reach a more united position and wring more concessions from Turkey. ''Beefing up the NATO mission in the Aegean is going to help European leaders like Ms. Merkel claim that there's progress bringing the situation under control,'' said Mujtaba Rahman, the Europe director for the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. ''But NATO is not the answer, so that means this really is about buying yet more time to reach some kind of solution where Turkey shows a willingness to keep refugees from leaving its shores in the first place,'' Mr. Rahman said.

''I'd see all these businesses that used to produce normal products, even brooms, that everybody uses and purchases today, but are not produced here -- they are produced overseas,'' he said. A construction manager, Mr. Mortensen escaped the waves of layoffs because his employer, which once built plants for heavy industry, is now in the demolition business. ''Those factories are gone, and I get to knock 'em down, unfortunately,'' he said. Which is how he and his wife, Kathy, ended up at a rally for Donald J. Trump, the anti-free-trade billionaire who promises to slap 35 percent tariffs on Ford cars built in Mexico. ''We're hopeful that Donald can bring those jobs back, and our neighbors, too,'' Mr. Mortensen said. Mr. Trump's appeal to blue-collar voters, mostly whites, is driving his popularity in Michigan, where he has a polling lead ahead of the Republican primary on Tuesday. And these same voters, who historically supported Democrats, are at the core of his strategy for winning the general election and turning Democratic-leaning Rust Belt states back into the red column. Mr. Trump's rally here on Friday was in Macomb County, where political strategists first identified the phenomenon of Reagan Democrats. These white, working-class voters felt the party no longer protected their economic interests as it focused on affirmative action, welfare and other policies aimed at minorities. If he is the nominee, Mr. Trump argues, he can deliver not only Michigan but other Rust Belt states, like Ohio and Pennsylvania, into the Republican column in November, broadening the party's traditional road to the White House. A ''normal Republican,'' Mr. Trump said at Macomb Community College, ''cannot think of bringing in Michigan, and if you don't bring in Michigan, it's tough. You have a very narrow road.'' ''But I'm going to bring in places like Michigan,'' he said, pledging to win back a once-solid Republican state that has supported Democrats in the last six presidential elections. The strategy might be a necessity if the party nominates Mr. Trump, because he would risk losing states, like Florida and Colorado, with large Hispanic populations. He has highly unfavorable ratings among Hispanic voters because of his call for a wall separating Mexico and his pledges to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants. Mr. Trump's signature issues of opposition to free trade and a crackdown on illegal immigration, which Republican leaders once dismissed as outside the mainstream, have brought him a populist following, including independents and some Democrats. ''I like what he wants to do with the immigration,'' said Marvin Bryant, a former salesman who attended the rally in Warren. Mr. Bryant switched his registration from Democrat to Republican last year, and plans to vote for Mr. Trump this week. Kurt Reidt, a captain of the Warren Fire Department, said his vote for Mr. Trump on Tuesday in the state's open primary would be his first ever for a Republican. ''This is probably the worst state in the country with the economy,'' Mr. Reidt said as he entered the rally with members of his firehouse. Although Republican nominees for decades have carried the vote of white men without college degrees, they are a shrinking share of the electorate. Mr. Trump's ability to win Rust Belt states in a general election would require him to turn out these voters in historically large numbers. On Super Tuesday last week, he won 59 percent of voters without college degrees in Massachusetts and a plurality of 44 percent in Virginia, according to exit polls, en route to winning both states. He won much lower shares of voters who had graduated from college. In Massachusetts, 20,000 Democrats gave up their party registrations to vote in the Republican primary, which Mr. Trump won commandingly. ''Look, we have expanded the Republican Party,'' he said on the night of his Super Tuesday victories, when Republican turnout surged in most of the 11 states that voted. But election experts say some of that surge came from people who were motivated to vote against Mr. Trump, which would also be a factor in the general election. ''Some polls show him getting about 20 percent of the Democratic vote,'' said G. Terry Madonna, who has long polled Pennsylvania. ''They live in the Appalachian mountain chain, not just in Pennsylvania. The problem is, he would lose many center-right and moderate Republican voters who make up the voter-rich suburbs in key swing states.'' Stanley B. Greenberg, whose research in Macomb County in the 1980s popularized the term ''Reagan Democrat,'' said Mr. Trump might put the Rust Belt into play. ''There's no doubt there's new voters coming into the Republican primary process,'' he said. But Mr. Greenberg added that there was an equal potential for a backlash in an electorate that is more racially and culturally diverse. ''The country's changed pretty dramatically from the time when Reagan Democrats were calling the shots,'' he said. Mr. Trump spoke extensively in Macomb County about his plan to bring back manufacturing jobs, especially automotive jobs. He said he would pick up the phone to call the chief of any American company that moved factories to Mexico and threaten a 35 percent tariff (even though the president does not have that authority, and experts say if Congress agreed, it would likely set off a trade war). ''Within 24 to 48 hours'' of such an ultimatum, Mr. Trump claimed, the chief of Ford would be on the phone. ''They'll say: 'Mr. President, we're moving back. Would you like us to move to Michigan?' I'll say, 'Yeah, I really want you to move to Michigan.' And they'll move back.'' Since entering the race, Mr. Trump has harped on Ford's investment of $2.5 billion in a Mexico plant. The automaker's chief executive, Mark Fields, has said he sent Mr. Trump a letter pointing out that the company had also invested $10 billion in the United States and created more than 25,000 jobs since 2011. Representative Sander M. Levin, a Democrat who represents Macomb County in Washington, and who has opposed major trade deals for decades, said Mr. Trump was playing on people's fears with no practical solutions. ''He pushes the buttons, but there's nothing behind it,'' Mr. Levin said. ''The 35 percent tariff thing isn't workable.'' ''I think people more and more will realize it's demagogic,'' he added. But a sampling of two dozen voters who heard Mr. Trump on Friday turned up little skepticism about his promises. They felt strongly that he was the lone truth teller in the race. Many said they were doing well economically, even while painting a grim portrait of the state and the nation on issues like immigration and national security. Although the number of private-sector jobs has not returned to prerecession levels, Michigan's unemployment rate has fallen to 5.1 percent, down from nearly 15 percent at the height of the recession. Detroit's automakers are experiencing record sales. Nonetheless, the narrative of decline is pervasive, especially because many of the new jobs being created pay far less. ''We've got McDonald's and Burger King jobs, and that's about it,'' said Mr. Reidt, the fire captain. Gary Ragland, a retired time clock repairman, said his job had allowed him glimpses of a world of blue-collar jobs in auto plants, breweries and hospitals. ''If you lose our manufacturing, you lose your country,'' he said. Although he was not sure Mr. Trump's plan for imposing 35 percent tariffs would bring back factories, he thought the threat alone could shake things up. ''You can't have a sissy up there; you've got to have a man,'' he said. ''He has shown America -- anybody that's awake -- what the hell is going on.''

LUCIE, Fla. --  At some point near the end of spring training, Tim Teufel, the Mets' third-base coach, will gather the team for a meeting to demonstrate and decode the hand signs they will use this season. One sequence of signs may tell a batter to bunt, or tell a runner to steal, or tell them both that the hit-and-run is on. Teufel has about 10 signs, and he uses his own elaborate system to relay them, just to make the enterprise that much harder for an opponent to pick up on. Most years, Teufel keeps some of his system the same, tweaking it here and there. But this year, because Daniel Murphy signed with the Washington Nationals in free agency and Bob Geren left to take a coaching job with the Los Angeles Dodgers, Teufel is starting over -- the baseball equivalent of changing the locks after a bad breakup. ''The way I do them,'' Teufel said, ''no one will get them.'' When players change teams, the Mets generally believe, no one is above stealing signs, but Murphy's situation is somewhat different. Not only does he know the Mets' inner workings after nearly a decade in the organization, but he also joined the Nationals, the team most likely to stand between the Mets and a division title. Murphy now appears to be at the center of a burgeoning rivalry. Last year, Washington was the heavy favorite in the National League East, but the Mets, with Murphy helping to lead the way, swept the Nationals twice down the stretch and won the division. After the disappointing finish, the Nationals replaced Manager Matt Williams with Dusty Baker and signed Murphy, hoping he would provide a veteran presence. The Nationals placed Murphy's spring training locker next to Bryce Harper's, in a corner of the room with other veteran leaders. Harper, who last season became the fourth-youngest player to win a Most Valuable Player Award, began studying Murphy's routine in the batting cage and the weight room and picking his brain about the game. Baker figured that at some point this season, Murphy could offer some useful tips about the Mets during scouting meetings. ''As long as they don't change too much of their personnel, he could be a tremendous asset to us,'' Baker said. ''I mean, we took one of their spiritual leaders, one of their team leaders. And we didn't take him; they gave him to us.'' Baseball, however, does not rely on set plays. When a player changes teams, he cannot take a playbook with him; his knowledge about his former teammates is harder to define. Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson pointed out that much of the information on plays could be quantified with statistics and was widely distributed. Jerry Blevins, a left-handed reliever the Mets acquired from the Nationals last year, said the Mets did not ''interrogate'' him about the Nationals when he arrived ''because there are no secrets in baseball, for the most part; everything we do is documented.'' The one secret, then, may be a team's signs and its system of relaying them. When a Met turns to Teufel, the first thing he looks for is an indicator, a sign that tells the player that the actual sign is coming. It could be as simple as Teufel tugging at his ear. Without the indicator, Teufel's hand motions are meaningless. Once the indicator has been given, Teufel uses a series of gestures to communicate the signal. That could involve touching his belt, his hat -- anything. At any point, though, Teufel could also use a wipe-off move, a gesture meaning the sign is off. That way, he can toggle back and forth, putting the sign on and taking it off. All the while, Teufel also uses diversions. For example, he could communicate to the players that his right hand is relaying the actual sign while his left hand is a decoy. The system can become so complicated that sometimes he puts a sign on by accident and has to erase it. ''I can put a sign on, take it off, put it back on, take it off,'' Teufel said. ''You can't follow it all. It happens too quickly. You may think you've got it, but you don't really.'' The Mets also use signs when defending against bunts. Teufel relays a sign from the dugout to David Wright at third base, and that tells the infielders, the pitcher and the catcher where to be. Those signs will also change this spring. The Mets figure they cannot trust the Nationals at all. As Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo said, ''they're the king of the mountain, and we're trying to knock them off.''

Manning was to speak to the news media on Monday at 1 p.m. Eastern time at the Broncos' facility south of Denver. ESPN was the first on Sunday to report the news of his retirement. ''When you look at everything Peyton has accomplished as a player and person, it's easy to see how fortunate we've been to have him on our team,'' John Elway, the Broncos' executive vice president for football operations and general manager, told DenverBroncos.com. ''Peyton was everything we thought he was and even more -- not only for the football team, but in the community.'' The son and brother of N.F.L. quarterbacks, Manning, who turns 40 on March 24, was a league royal who, in his years with the Indianapolis Colts and the Broncos, earned a record five Most Valuable Player awards and two Super Bowl titles. His N.F.L. records include most career passing yards, most touchdown passes, most game-winning drives, most games started and most wins as a starting quarterback, 200, a record he achieved by defeating the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50 in February. It was not his best day, but it was good enough for him to become the only quarterback to lead two franchises to Super Bowl victories, the first coming at the end of the 2006 season with the Indianapolis Colts' win over the Chicago Bears, 29-17. He was the most valuable player in that game. Chosen as the first overall draft pick in 1998, he was also one of the N.F.L.'s most telegenic players, a regular television presence pitching cars, pizza, insurance and other products, and a favorite with the sports media for much of his career. According to Spotrac, an online database for sports salaries, Manning earned more than $248 million during his career, not including income from endorsements and other off-field ventures. Yet he leaves the league amid some controversy, including a renewed focus on a sexual harassment case from his days at the University of Tennessee and allegations, raised in an Al Jazeera documentary, that he used human growth hormone, a banned substance, to help recover from a serious neck injury a few years ago. Manning years ago settled the first case, filed by a trainer who accused Manning of pinning her down while exposing himself. The incident occurred in 1996 but was raised again in recent weeks after new details came out. He has denied the allegations in the Al Jazeera report, in which a pharmacist in an undercover interview suggested that Manning took H.G.H. ''It never happened,'' Manning said of the allegations he took banned substances. ''Never. I really can't believe somebody would put something like this on the air. Whoever said this is making stuff up.'' Manning said he used a hyperbaric chamber at the clinic to speed his recovery. The Al Jazeera report said that Manning's wife received an unspecified number of shipments of H.G.H. sent from the clinic. Manning said his wife's medical status was private. The pharmacist who leveled the claim recanted his statements in a YouTube video made after Manning's legal representatives visited him but before the Al Jazeera report was broadcast. The N.F.L. and antidoping authorities are investigating the matter, but it is unclear how far their inquiry will proceed now that Manning is retiring. Still, with his records, and his having been chosen to play in the Pro Bowl 14 times, he seems a sure bet to be elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Only twice during his career did he play on teams with losing records. Manning has not indicated what he will do in retirement. He could join the line of former star quarterbacks like Troy Aikman and become a television broadcaster. Media reports have also linked him to the Tennessee Titans, who could employ him as a front office executive. The Broncos, though, were already preparing for the departure of Manning, who had one year remaining on his current contract worth $19 million ahead of Monday's scheduled announcement. The team appears close to reaching a three-year deal with Manning's longtime understudy, Brock Osweiler, who started several games last season while Manning was injured.

Sure, by winning 11 of the 17 contests since her New Hampshire drubbing, and running away with the delegate count, she's not far from sewing up the Democratic presidential nomination. It's the Republicans, not the Democrats, who face bitter divides that endanger the party's future. Mrs. Clinton is riding high; that's the problem. ''Her history is that whenever she gets ahead and looks in good shape, she reverts to her worst form,'' said Peter D. Hart, a leading Democratic pollster, citing Mrs. Clinton's stellar first debate performance. The Democrats' confidence is based on the perceived folly of Republicans' nominating Donald J. Trump. But a lot can change in a few months and the Democrats' own house has some needs. There is a demonstrable lack of enthusiasm about Mrs. Clinton, the likely nominee, underscored by the low turnouts in most contests. She is identified as part of the establishment by a restless electorate, and she is neither especially liked nor trusted by many swing voters, and even some Democrats. ''She seems out of sync with the electorate,'' J. Ann Selzer said after looking at the surveys conducted by her firm, Selzer & Company, for Bloomberg, as well as primary exit polls. ''For someone who started her campaign on a listening tour she doesn't seem to be listening.'' Mrs. Clinton's likability issues go back a ways. In New Hampshire eight years ago, Barack Obama cracked, ''You're likable enough, Hillary.'' The lack of trust is more recent. Her shortcomings, as perceived by voters, would change little. ''She laps the field on competence and skills to do the job,'' Mr. Hart said. ''What she needs to do is neutralize the personal distaste.'' He suggested that ''she needs an event most days that is personal, human, sometimes even light.'' He added that the public needs to see more of the emotional side she displayed at a town hall in December, when she comforted a girl with asthma who had been bullied. David Plouffe, who managed Mr. Obama's winning campaign against Mrs. Clinton eight years ago, concurs, noting that it's a myth that voters know all about her given that she has been around for a quarter century: ''The key in this race is to define the race, her opponent and herself.'' Mr. Plouffe said this definition has to be ''authentic'' and ''tied to her sense of advocacy, which would reveal interesting sides of herself.'' If she did this well, he added, it could offer a comparative advantage with Mr. Trump -- ''this is a place he can't go.'' The trustworthiness problem is deeper, more difficult. It stems from some issues that are unfair to her, such as the 2012 terrorist attack on a United States diplomatic installation in Benghazi, Libya, in which four Americans were killed. Capitol Hill Republicans tried and failed to use the incident to tarnish her. But some of her wounds are self-inflicted, such as her use of a private email server as secretary of state and the huge speaking fees she received for private talks to Wall Street companies. Democratic strategists suggest that there's no easy way to deal with it. Some talk about her doing a so-called Sister Souljah moment, a reference to her husband's criticism of a black rapper in 1992. This would require Mrs. Clinton to take an unpopular, even risky position, displaying courage -- a character point. That, however, is probably not in her political DNA. A general election campaign against Mr. Trump would be filled with fear and loathing. His Republican rivals Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz can tell her how dirty the fight against the New York billionaire can get. Leading Democrats are confident that with her superior knowledge and intellectual agility, she can handle this. What worries them more is her recurring tendency, when on top, to show hubris.

Each year brought several dozen new songs, a sign of an artist obsessed with sound, and also with his own freedom to create. In so doing, he marked the beginning of the second wave of the modern mixtape era, in which artists began to wrest control of the pacing of their output from the hands of record labels, who preferred neat album cycles. Eventually, these samizdat drops -- be they in the form of DatPiff downloads or SoundCloud links -- took on the qualities of official releases. Whole generations of rappers began defining the pace and terms of their ascent outside traditional albums. From Drake to Lil B, self-released, nonalbum music became an essential career engine, and the norm. Late last week, two rappers looking for ways to balance celebrity with freedom released new projects. For Kendrick Lamar -- possible inheritor of Lil Wayne's ''greatest rapper alive'' mantle -- there was ''untitled unmastered.'' (TDE/Aftermath/Interscope), a collection of demos collected over the past three years, the era in which he went from connoisseur's pick to mainstream star. And for Lil Wayne, there was ''Collegrove'' (Def Jam), the new album by 2 Chainz, on which he makes several appearances. These are vastly different projects that serve a similar purpose: an outlet outside of the onerous narrative demands of the traditional album cycle. For Mr. Lamar, a rapper at the peak of his powers and reach, and one who resists many of mainstream hip-hop's central preoccupations, it's an opportunity to become even more insular. For Lil Wayne, a few years past his prime, and struggling to regain relevance, it's an opportunity to play loose on someone else's field, accessing a level of creativity he's mostly left in the past. Mr. Lamar's ''untitled unmastered.'' is a companion piece to his excellent 2015 album, ''To Pimp a Butterfly.'' These are songs from the same sessions, and he has even performed versions of some of them on television in recent years: ''The Colbert Report,'' ''The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon'' and the Grammy Awards. These new old songs use many of the same musicians that made ''Butterfly'' so singular. The bass by Thundercat and saxophone by Terrace Martin on ''untitled 05 | 09.21.2014.'' are as potent as anything on ''Butterfly,'' as is the luscious singing by SZA on ''untitled 04 | 08.14.2014.'' Lyrically, Mr. Lamar plays with familiar themes of personal responsibility, sociological darkness and, on ''untitled 07 | 2014-2016,'' his underdiscussed flirtatious side. And of course, there's religion, which hangs over all of Mr. Lamar's work, as on ''untitled 01 | 08.19.2014.,'' in which he interrogates a higher power: I made ''To Pimp a Butterfly'' 'fore you told meTo use my vocals to save mankind for youSay I didn't try for you, say I didn't ride for youI tithed for you, I pushed the club to the side for youWho love you like I love you? ''Untitled unmastered.'' also shows off a slightly unpolished side of Mr. Lamar, who on his albums is one of the most meticulous rappers ever, but who, appealingly, shows off some casual studio talk on ''untitled 07.'' (These moments are akin to ''The Life of Pablo,'' the latest album by Kanye West, which wove internal process into its public face.) Mr. Lamar is a rapper who isn't stingy with his talent, and also one who's made few compromises. For him, a project like ''untitled unmastered.'' doesn't reveal secrets so much as demonstrate that he's as capable of unanticipated explosions as anyone else. Such explosions were once the norm for Lil Wayne, who at 33 is already an elder, and one who hasn't developed a viable late-career approach. He's been largely silent the last few years, locked in a very public battle of wills with Baby, the head of his label, Cash Money Records. When he has released music, it's been ill-advised and coolly received. His rhymes, once the most inventive in the genre, have been badly desiccated. But what's this on ''Blue C-Note,'' one of the better tracks on ''Collegrove'' -- a sign of life from a fading star? Dreadlock Rasta, hair like pastaI don't see what's your problem, I need an eye doctorFlying to them dollars, ducking fly swattersShoot him in the head, leave his mind boggled Here are all the hallmarks of old Wayne: concise construction, tricky assonance, oddball imagery, black humor. And there are a handful of moments like this on ''Collegrove,'' almost enough to balance out the tired ones (''What Happened,'' ''Section''). His best verses here are his most spirited rapping in at least two years. Consider the context, though. ''Collegrove'' isn't even a full collaborative album, but a 2 Chainz album on which he plays sidekick. (There it is in the credits: ''Lil Wayne appears courtesy of Cash Money Records Inc.'') 2 Chainz is an ornery rapper, occasionally stumbling into vivid word clouds. Every time he heads in an unexpected direction here, Lil Wayne seems eager to step up to the challenge. Even his throwaway lines -- ''Asinine/ I get blow like dandelions'' -- have the eyebrow-arching zing of his prime. Maybe some time away from the spotlight has calmed him. Maybe the seeming détente in his relationship with Baby has freed him. Or maybe appearing on someone else's album, rather than his own, has allowed him to be loose once more.

63,The New York Times,7-Mar-16,Not Everyone Says Headgear Is Right Fit for Girls' Lacrosse,Late Edition - Final,,,By BILL PENNINGTON,ENGLISH,,,UNITED STATES (90%); NORTH AMERICA (79%),Section D; Column 0; Sports Desk; Pg. 1,"MARYLAND, USA (90%); NEW YORK, USA (79%)",Newspaper,,,1726 words,"PHOTOS: The girls' lacrosse team at the Bullis School, in Maryland, has worn rugby-style helmets for five years. (D1)  The Bullis School, located in Potomac, Md., before a game this month. Since helmets were used, concussions have declined.

While boys' lacrosse players have been required to wear hard-shell helmets for years, in the girls' game, which is played by vastly different rules that generally forbid contact, only goalies are obligated to wear helmets. But with girls' lacrosse players wielding reinforced sticks and firing 60-mile-per-hour shots with a hard, unyielding ball, serious head injuries do occur. In a climate of heightened awareness about head trauma in athletics and with a substantial rate of concussions in girls' lacrosse documented by recent studies, the push for some kind of headgear in the sport has gained traction. There has, however, always been one intractable obstacle: There has never been a standardized, certified headgear designed for girls' lacrosse and endorsed by the sport's governing body, U.S. Lacrosse. That will soon change with new, regulated headgear set to appear in stores in several months. If sales take off, the headgear, which is approved by U.S. Lacrosse, could alter the landscape of girls' and women's lacrosse forever. Some of the sport's longest-tenured coaches and officials worry that the headgear, though optional for now, will lead to more aggressive play and will ultimately ruin the nuanced spirit of the game, which has been played in North America for about a century. ''I do fear for the future,'' said Erin Brown Millon, a former United States national team player and current coach who directed U.S. Lacrosse's women's division for six years. Millon is afraid that increased headgear use may set off a slippery slope of rougher play, which could eventually lead to arm, shoulder and chest padding -- equipment already worn in boys' lacrosse. ''When we get to that point,'' said Millon, who is in the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame, ''the uniqueness and special nature of women's lacrosse will be lost forever.'' Despite these concerns, the groundswell of support for some kind of head protection continues to build. Last year, the Florida High School Athletic Association mandated the use of headgear during all girls' lacrosse games and practices, even though there was no nationally approved headgear. Florida athletes mostly wear the modified headbands occasionally used in soccer. Other states have taken notice. An effort to require headgear in New York stalled four years ago. But the body that governs high school sports in the state expects to reconsider the move now that there is a girls-specific headgear standard approved by U.S. Lacrosse and ASTM International, a widely recognized organization that develops and publishes standards for a range of products. ''Our girls' lacrosse committee and our safety committee will have further discussions,'' Todd Nelson, the assistant director of the New York State Public High School Athletic Association, said Wednesday. ''Additionally, we'll have to decide: Do we want to mandate that all players wear the ASTM-approved headgear?'' Nelson said that at last summer's national meeting of state high school association executives, officials from Michigan and Virginia also voiced concerns about the lack of protective headgear in girls' lacrosse. ''We do anticipate that some policy makers will move to require it,'' Ann Carpenetti, the vice president of lacrosse operations for U.S. Lacrosse, said of the standardized optional headgear, which must cover the entire head but also be of a malleable material so it does not imperil players without headgear. Carpenetti added that U.S. Lacrosse was not likely to challenge any state or organization that imposed a headgear mandate unless they were going to put female players in the hard plastic helmets worn in boys' lacrosse. Carpenetti also said she did not think that college teams, governed by the N.C.A.A. and a slightly different rule book, would adopt a headgear requirement. As with other sports like football and ice hockey, no headgear, even hard-shell helmets, has been proven to prevent all concussions. But headgear has been effective in lessening head trauma caused by stick-to-head or ball-to-head contact. Exactly what the new girls' lacrosse headgear will look like is a mystery that has left lacrosse coaches and administrators restless with anticipation. The major manufacturers of lacrosse equipment are not saying much, perhaps fearful of tipping their hands in a competitive market. But at least one manufacturer, Cascade, has tested its product with focus groups and plans to have the headgear ready for consumers when the new headgear terminology of the National Federation of High Schools/U.S. Lacrosse rule book goes into effect on Jan. 1. At that time, any headgear that players choose to wear must conform to the ASTM standard, which is packed with research and test-driven language but vague on aesthetics. But the optional, soft-sided headgear permitted in past girls' lacrosse games, like those currently in use in Florida, would not conform to the new standards. At least two other manufacturers of lacrosse gear, STX and Team 22, the authorized licensee of Under Armour, said they were also developing new headgear for women's lacrosse. An STX spokeswoman said the company's headgear would be ready as soon as its lab and field testing were completed. Team 22 indicated that its headgear model was ''not in the final stages.'' A spokeswoman for Brine, which has been selling lacrosse equipment since the 1920s, had no comment when asked about the opportunity to develop headgear under the new standard. The marketplace could be highly lucrative, as there are nearly 300,000 female lacrosse players in the United States, and the number is expanding rapidly. The number of American high schools with girls' lacrosse teams increased by more than 31 percent from 2009 to 2014, according to U.S. Lacrosse. But meeting the ASTM standard will be challenging. While the approved headgear cannot have a hard outer shell or sharp protruding parts, it is required to absorb the impact of a ball traveling 60 m.p.h. or a stick swung at 45 m.p.h. The headgear, which must be flexible enough to pass what is called a deformation test, also has to be compatible with protective eyewear, one of the sport's few required pieces of equipment. Kevin Davis, chief executive of the Performance Sports Group, the holding company for Cascade, said his engineers were intrigued by an assignment that required a melding of the seemingly opposing dynamics of softness and hardness. The company has gone through multiple iterations of its headgear, especially after consulting with players. Players who have not yet seen the new headgear are not sure how receptive they will be to it. ''I don't think I will like it,'' said Baylee Barker, a sophomore who plays for St. Stephen's Episcopal School in Bradenton, Fla. ''The headbands they're making us wear in Florida now give me headaches. And on the package they come in, it's literally in writing that they don't prevent concussions. ''So I don't see how they're helping.'' Other schools have embraced headgear in some form and found a reduction in head injuries. After seven players on the girls' lacrosse team at the Bullis School in Maryland sustained concussions in 2011, the team put every player in a rugby-style helmet that covered each player's entire head. Five seasons later, the number of concussions -- many of them caused by stick-to-head contact -- has dropped dramatically. ''It's had an impact and parents appreciate it,'' the Bullis coach, Kathleen Lloyd, said of the headgear. ''It might be more about raising awareness about contacting the head. There is a visual reminder.'' Lloyd also said she did not detect members of her team playing more aggressively than they had before donning the headgear. The idea that athletes will play rougher if wearing extra padding is known as the ''gladiator effect'' and dates to at least the early 20th century, when it was suggested that college football players were hitting with more ferocity because they had begun to wear leather helmets. In 1986, Massachusetts high school officials required that girls' lacrosse players wear hard ice hockey helmets. The experiment ended after several years, and the consensus was that offensive players were more likely to instigate contact with opposing defenders, and vice versa. But many current coaches, while not advocating the use of the optional headgear next year, maintain that they can control how rough the game will get if headgear becomes more prevalent. ''Our game is not going to change because the rules aren't going to change,'' said Carter Abbott, the head coach and athletic director at the Pingry School in New Jersey. ''Headgear or no headgear, it's about training coaches to teach the game the right way. It's about educational programs for game officials.'' If multiple states follow Florida's lead next year and mandate headgear in girls' high school lacrosse games, it will undoubtedly inflame a controversy that has -- in the words of one coach -- ''plagued the sport for decades.'' And the new headgear standard, in some quarters, could end up being blamed for abetting the headgear movement. But Carpenetti, the U.S. Lacrosse vice president, insisted that settling on a unified, approved headgear standard was meant to save the traditions of girls' and women's lacrosse. If U.S. Lacrosse did not respond quickly to the mounting worries about head injuries in girls' high school lacrosse, Carpenetti believed inaction might have spawned more radical measures. ''We felt if we didn't take this approach, then putting men's lacrosse helmets on girls' lacrosse players would be a quicker road to a changed game,'' Carpenetti said. LeeAnn Fronckowiak, the head coach at St. Stephen's Episcopal School in Florida, grew up playing lacrosse as a child in upstate New York. She is now dreading a worst-case situation. ''A lot of us coaches talk about where things are going and what might happen to girls' lacrosse,'' Fronckowiak said. ''And we've all agreed that if they change too much, it will be time to leave the game, because it's just going to be the boys' game. ''The beauty of our game will be gone.''

Even the most hardened cynics couldn't have imagined that the candidates would sink so low, and stay so focused on personal insults. Yet last week, offstage, there was in effect a real debate about economic policy between Donald Trump and Mitt Romney, who is trying to block his nomination. Unfortunately, both men are talking nonsense. Are you surprised? The starting point for this debate is Mr. Trump's deviation from free-market orthodoxy on international trade. Attacks on immigrants are still the central theme of the Republican front-runner's campaign, but he has opened a second front on trade deficits, which he asserts are being caused by the currency manipulation of other countries, especially China. This manipulation, he says, is ''robbing Americans of billions of dollars of capital and millions of jobs.'' His solution is ''countervailing duties'' -- basically tariffs -- similar to those we routinely impose when foreign countries are found to be subsidizing exports in violation of trade agreements. Mr. Romney claims to be aghast. In his stop-Trump speech last week he warned that if The Donald became president America would ''sink into prolonged recession.'' Why? The only specific reason he gave was that those duties would ''instigate a trade war and that would raise prices for consumers, kill our export jobs and lead entrepreneurs and businesses of all stripes to flee America.'' This is pretty funny if you remember anything about the 2012 campaign. Back then, in accepting Mr. Trump's endorsement, Mr. Romney praised the businessman (who was already a well-known ''birther'') as someone with an ''extraordinary ability to understand how our economy works.'' But wait, it gets better: at the time, Mr. Romney was saying almost exactly the same things Mr. Trump is saying now. He promised to -- you guessed it -- declare China a currency manipulator, while attacking President Obama for failing to do so. And he brushed off concerns about starting a trade war, declaring that one was already underway: ''It's a silent one, and they're winning.'' More important than Mr. Romney's awkward history here, however, is the fact that his economic analysis is all wrong. Protectionism can do real harm, making economies less efficient and reducing long-run growth. But it doesn't cause recessions. Why not? Doesn't a trade war reduce employment in export industries? Yes, and it also increases employment in industries that compete with imports. In fact, a worldwide trade war would, by definition, reduce imports by exactly the same amount that it reduces exports. There's no reason to assume that the net effect on employment would be strongly negative. But didn't protectionism cause the Great Depression? No, it didn't -- protectionism was a result of the Depression, not its cause. By the way, if you want an example of a policy that really did have a lot to do with the Great Depression's spread, that would be the gold standard -- which Ted Cruz wants to restore. So Mr. Romney is talking nonsense. But so is Mr. Trump. Five years ago the Trump complaint that Chinese currency manipulation was costing U.S. jobs had some validity -- in fact, serious economists were making the same point. But these days China is in big trouble, and is trying to keep the value of its currency up, not down: foreign exchange reserves are plunging in the face of huge capital flight, to the tune of a trillion dollars over the past year. Nor is China alone. All around the world, capital is fleeing troubled economies -- including, by the way, the euro area, which these days tends to run bigger trade surpluses than China. And much of that flight capital is heading for the United States, pushing up the dollar and making our industries less competitive. It's a real problem; U.S. economic fundamentals are fairly strong, but we risk, in effect, importing economic weakness from the rest of the world. But it's not a problem we can address by lashing out at foreigners we falsely imagine are winning at our expense. What can we do to fight imported economic weakness? That's a big subject, but one thing is for sure: given the pressures from abroad, and the worrying strength of the dollar, the Federal Reserve really, really needs to hold off on raising interest rates. Did I mention that Mr. Trump wants to see rates rise? Not only that, but he's a full-on conspiracy theorist, declaring that Janet Yellen, the Fed's chairperson, is keeping interest rates down as a favor to President Obama, who ''wants to be out playing golf a year from now.'' So there you have it. The good news is that there was a real policy debate going on within the G.O.P. last week. The bad news is that it was junk economics on both sides.

Until then, fans in the sellout crowd had seemed content to relish their proximity to the star power of the Golden State Warriors, to bask in the ceremonial nostalgia of Kobe Bryant's final games in the N.B.A., to sit back and enjoy a sleepy, late-season day game. The outcome seemed like a tertiary concern. But in the second quarter, they peeked up en masse at the scoreboard, and the Los Angeles Lakers were winning. Four minutes into the quarter, D'Angelo Russell drained two 3-pointers in less than half a minute, giving the Lakers a 7-point advantage and causing the arena to fill with aggressive cheers. The lead grew to 14 shortly before halftime, and the highly improbable felt faintly possible. The unlikely scenes went on, and the noise and tension grew accordingly. Golden State kept stumbling, and the Lakers kept up the pressure, until the Warriors spiraled to just their sixth loss of the season, 112-95. Looking around a roomful of reporters at a postgame news conference, Bryant sensed a momentary letup in questions. ''I'm just as speechless as you are about tonight,'' he said with a wide smile. The tone of the contest before it began suggested a crossover episode of a sitcom: Stephen Curry and Bryant, protagonists in two of the league's most absorbing serial story lines this season, each congenially cohabiting the other's universe for a few hours under the theater lights of Staples Center. It was a farewell tour joining a traveling circus. The result seemed like a forgone conclusion. The Warriors (55-6), who are chasing the 72-win record of the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls, had been trouncing some of the league's best teams. If they slipped up, it was not going to be against the Lakers (13-51). The teams had met three previous times this season, and these were Golden State's winning scores: 111-77, 109-88 and 116-98. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, it was the first time in N.B.A. history that a team with a winning percentage higher than 90 percent played a team with a winning percentage lower than 20 percent at least 50 games into a season. But the Warriors, for whatever reason, looked lost. They trailed by 60-49 at halftime and had 11 turnovers after two quarters, compared with the Lakers' one. They finished the game 4 of 30 from 3-point range. Curry (18 points) and Klay Thompson (15 points) -- long ago nicknamed the Splash Brothers for their long-range prowess -- shot a combined 13 for 40 from the field, including a remarkable 1 for 18 from 3-point range. ''It was just one of those days you want to avoid at all costs,'' Curry said. ''But it happened, and we'll be all right.'' Steve Kerr, the Warriors' coach, spent most of the game slumped in his seat, his chin burrowed into his hand as he exhaled deeply. He received a technical in the fourth quarter for arguing with the referees. After the game, Kerr said his players had been careless and unfocused on offense and had not followed the team's game plan on defense. He said he was happy for the Lakers, and he kept a sense of humor about his own players. ''This team is filled with millennials, and millennials can't focus,'' said Kerr, who has made the relative youth of his team a running joke this season. ''We looked like the millennials tonight.'' Before the stunning result, the game represented a meeting of two of the game's biggest stars at hugely disparate points of their careers. Bryant arrived at the arena wearing a charcoal-colored suit, a black shirt and a black tie. Curry stepped off the bus looking like a college student, with ripped jeans, a bomber jacket, headphones and a backpack. Curry thanked Bryant for all that he had done for the game throughout the years. Bryant encouraged Curry to strive to get better, to achieve more. Bryant had feasted on Golden State during his long career. He entered the game having made 624 baskets in 66 games against the Warriors in his career, his most against any one opposing team. Bryant played a little more than 24 minutes on Sunday, contributing 12 points while shooting 4 for 14 from the field. But the Lakers received contributions from all over their young, unaccomplished roster. Russell had 17 points in the first half and finished with 21. Jordan Clarkson led all scorers with 25. Nick Young drained two 3-pointers within the first three minutes of the fourth quarter, effectively stanching the Warriors' comeback chances. And Marcelo Huertas, the Lakers' hirsute backup point guard, levitated for multiple crafty finishes at the rim and doled out no-look passes to his teammates. Huertas finished with 10 points and 9 assists and received a standing ovation when he left the game. Bryant said he had been drilling ''basketball nerdy things'' into the heads of his teammates: angles, timing, rhythm. He said the win was not significant, but he added that it would help his young teammates grasp the point of their labor. ''For young guys, I think it's extremely important to see the results of that,'' Bryant said. The afternoon, then, provided an unlikely treat for the fans. But with less than two minutes remaining, they seemed to remember why they were there, and the arena filled with chants of ''Ko-be! Ko-be! Ko-be!'' until the final buzzer sounded. The players walked off the court. The fans lingered in their seats. Everyone appeared a bit dazed.

The 2016 baseball season, now getting underway, is the 59th since the team decamped to Los Angeles, leaving Brooklyn's baseball die-hards with pangs of heartsickness for the loss of Gil Hodges, Duke Snider and Pee Wee Reese and venomous animosity for the never-to-be-forgiven betrayal of the team owner, Walter O'Malley, who took them away. Of their ever-diminishing number, perhaps one man stood out above all: Tom Knight, the first and only official baseball historian of Brooklyn. Mr. Knight, who died at 89 on Feb. 17 in Brooklyn, where he lived his entire life except for time in the Army, was appointed to his unpaid post in 1976 by Sebastian Leone, then the Brooklyn borough president. It's not certain that he had any official duties, but his qualifications were indisputable. Mainly it was this one: He knew everything about the Dodgers. (About most other teams, too.) Mr. Knight had an enormous memorabilia collection. He gave tours of Brooklyn baseball landmarks that included not only the site of Ebbets Field, home of the Dodgers from 1913 until they left town (it was demolished in 1960), but also, in Green-Wood Cemetery, the grave of Charles Ebbets, who owned the team in the early 20th century. Something Mr. Knight knew but perhaps few others did: Professional baseball had existed in Brooklyn since at least 1883. The team that would eventually be the Dodgers was called the Grays, the Atlantics, the Grooms, the Bridegrooms and the Superbas. A team called the Brooklyn Greys also existed in 1883. The Dodgers have been called the Dodgers (a name deriving from the days of trolley lines that required dodging) uninterruptedly only since 1932. They were the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1911 and 1912, but the Brooklyn Robins from 1914 to 1931. For three decades Mr. Knight passed along information in that vein -- and in more fanatical veins than that -- in a regular column, ''Diamond Reflections,'' which appeared in The Brooklyn Eagle and other borough-centric publications in Brooklyn and on Staten Island. ''There are double plays and then there are unusual double plays,'' he wrote in 2012, before offering a handful of examples like the following one. (If you remember -- or have heard of -- these players, your baseball trivia quotient is superlative.) ''During the second game of a doubleheader in Boston on Aug. 11, 1940, Brooklyn Dodgers outfielder Joe Vosmik was on third, second baseman Johnny Hudson was on first and pitcher Vito Tamulis was at bat. Manager Leo Durocher signaled for a squeeze play. As Vosmik came tearing into the plate, Tamulis's bunt popped into the air and was caught by Boston pitcher Nick Strincevich, who kept right on running until he stepped on third to double off the embarrassed Vosmik.'' Thomas Robert Knight, whose death was confirmed by a friend, Bob McGee, left no immediate survivors. According to public records, he was born in Brooklyn on Sept. 17, 1926, to Thomas and Catherine Knight, and grew up in the Park Slope section. He worked for many years in public relations for the insurance brokerage firm Johnson & Higgins, Mr. McGee said. At his death he had lived for many years in Bay Ridge. Mr. Knight attended his first baseball game at Ebbets Field in August 1936, he wrote in a contribution to a 2003 book, ''When Baseball Returned to Brooklyn,'' about the arrival of a minor league team in Coney Island, the Brooklyn Cyclones. He watched the Dodgers lose to the Giants, 8-3, in a game in which Carl Hubbell, the Giants' left-handed screwballer who would win 26 games that season as a starting pitcher and be named the most valuable player in the National League and eventually make it to the Hall of Fame, pitched two and two-thirds innings in relief. Mr. McGee said that attending a game with Mr. Knight was likely to prompt a flood of information and anecdotes. Reporters seemed to find that as well. ''I always loved the story of Rudy York, who hit 18 home runs in one month for the Tigers in '37,'' Mr. Knight said in an interview with The New York Times shortly after he was appointed to the Brooklyn historian post. ''But he liked to drink a little, and once in Boston his teammates saw smoke coming out of his hotel room. ''They broke in the door and found the bed on fire and him in it. They pulled him out, and the manager says, 'Well, Rudy, I guess you was smoking in bed,' and Rudy replies: 'Like hell I was. That bed was on fire when I got into it.'''

And for Lecavalier, that is a very good thing. Lecavalier, a four-time All-Star and an integral member of the Tampa Bay Lightning's 2003-4 championship team, is now playing as a third-line center. His adjustment to a new role on a new team has been aided by the fact that his three young children have already been won over by Southern California, thanks in large part to a Disneyland trip during a recent day off. More important, though, Lecavalier is again contributing to a winning team after his impressive career had appeared to be skidding toward an unceremonious end. ''It's been a lot of fun, just being part of this organization and the guys I'm playing with and the coaching staff,'' Lecavalier said, adding, ''I'm really happy and really excited for the last 20 games and the playoffs.'' Those last 20 games and the playoffs -- the Kings sit in fifth in the Western Conference -- are all that remain for Lecavalier. Shortly after the Philadelphia Flyers traded him and defenseman Luke Schenn to the Kings on Jan. 6, Lecavalier announced that this season would be his last. Having joined a team seeking a third Stanley Cup in five seasons, Lecavalier, playing lately on a line between the captain Dustin Brown and Trevor Lewis, has been reinvigorated. ''He's helped me out a lot,'' Lewis said. ''He's a good veteran presence in the room. I think when he speaks, everyone listens. On the ice, he's been great.'' Without the benefit of a practice after the trade, Lecavalier and Schenn rushed to Staples Center, quickly making the acquaintance of their new teammates before taking the ice in a 2-1 win over the Toronto Maple Leafs on Jan. 7. Lecavalier instantly endeared himself to the Kings faithful with an assist on Los Angeles's first goal. He was not done there, collecting five goals and two assists in his first 11 games with Los Angeles. His point production has since slowed, but merely earning a regular shift is a far cry from the situation he left in Philadelphia. The Flyers had signed Lecavalier to a five-year deal in 2013, hoping he could regain the form that had made him a star with the Lightning. But Lecavalier never realized the lofty expectations that came with his $22.5 million contract. Midway through last season, his second with Philadelphia, he was a healthy scratch for the first time. His time with the Flyers hit a low point when he started this season as a healthy scratch and dressed for just seven of the team's first 38 games. ''Whatever your motivation is, to get back to playing or to get traded, you have to be in shape,'' Lecavalier said of the adversity he faced in Philadelphia. ''So you've got to keep your work ethic. You don't want to be a cancer in the locker room; you want to be a good guy. You don't want to be that guy that disrupts everything.'' After Lecavalier's trade, playing as a depth center behind the Kings stars Anze Kopitar and Jeff Carter was an unfamiliar job for a player who had been so heralded a prospect that Arthur L. Williams Jr., then Tampa Bay's owner, proclaimed shortly after taking Lecavalier first over all in the 1998 draft that he would become ''the Michael Jordan of hockey.'' The following season, at 19, Lecavalier became the youngest captain in N.H.L. history. The Lightning's management relieved Lecavalier of his captaincy during the 2001-2 season but handed it back to him in 2008, after he signed an 11-year, $85 million contract that made him among the highest-paid players in N.H.L. history. Tampa Bay bought out the contract five years in, ending Lecavalier's tenure with the franchise. ''I definitely don't look back; I look forward and in the present,'' he said. ''At the end, I'm here because I want to help the team win as much as possible. That's all I want.'' Lecavalier's reclamation in Los Angeles started with a startling realization. It turned out that after more than a decade as a first-line star, Lecavalier still had plenty to learn about hockey. ''Supporting the puck is huge here,'' Lecavalier said. ''Just the importance of playing solid in your zone may be something I didn't really have the last 17 years. There are some teams where there is a system for some guys, but here everyone is playing the same way. I think that's what makes this team special. ''I used to go away from the play all the time and wonder some games why I didn't touch the puck. Now I know why, 10 years later. It's a team game, I find here. Going all through the lineup, everybody has a role. Every individual feels important.'' Lecavalier's willingness to assume a supporting role immediately caught the attention of Kings Coach Darryl Sutter, not known for suffering fools gladly. ''He had to be on the right team, in the right situation,'' Sutter said. ''It's a good fit if he's got the passion to do it. There's a point in everybody's career where that passion diminishes, but his certainly hasn't. That's why I think he's a Hall of Fame player.'' Sutter still has vivid memories of Lecavalier's crowning achievement in the N.H.L. As the coach of the Calgary Flames in 2004, Sutter lost to Lecavalier's Lightning in the Stanley Cup finals, a riveting seven-game series in which each of the final four contests was decided by a single goal. With the end of his long career in sight, Lecavalier, who turns 36 in April, is hoping for another championship run -- this time in a very different position. ''It's a different role that I've never been through,'' Lecavalier said. ''But I really enjoy it.''

The contentious plan, promoted by a group of liberal Israeli Jews and adopted in principle by the center-left Labor Party, would unilaterally fence off most of East Jerusalem's Palestinian neighborhoods and transfer responsibility for their 200,000 residents from City Hall to the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli military in the occupied West Bank. Kicked off with advertisements under the heading ''Saving Jewish Jerusalem,'' the campaign's almost jingoistic tone seems intended to appeal to the broadest Jewish constituency, including Israel's growing political center and conservative ''nationalist camp.'' Instead, it has been rejected at both ends of the political spectrum, as well as by Palestinian leaders. The new campaign describes Jerusalem's Palestinian residents as imperiling the security, demographic balance, standard of living and economy of the city. It argues that a majority of people 18 and under in the city are Palestinian and plays on fears raised by the recent surge of Palestinian attacks against Israeli Jews. Ir Amim, a leftist group that advocates a status for Jerusalem as a dual capital of Israel and of a future Palestine, said the proposal was ''detached from any understanding of the fabric of daily life in Jerusalem.'' Without agreement from the Palestinian leadership, the group added, such a move would ''lead to political, urban and humanitarian chaos.'' Moshe Arens, a former minister from the conservative Likud Party, wrote in a recent column that any such split ''has become essentially impossible'' and that stripping East Jerusalem Arabs of their Israeli residency permits ''would be legally questionable and morally reprehensible.'' Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, called the proposal ''racist.'' ''Thousands of Jerusalemites will be separated from their schools, hospitals, religious sites and also their properties,'' he said. ''This plan clearly shows that even members of the so-called progressive Israeli camp are falling into the same policies of the Israeli right.'' Dividing Jerusalem, with sacred Jewish, Muslim and Christian sites at its core, has long been one of the most emotional and intractable issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel conquered Jerusalem's Old City and its environs, along with the West Bank, from Jordan in the 1967 war. Then it expanded the city limits, taking in 28 West Bank villages on the high ground surrounding the city, and annexed the territory in a move that was never internationally recognized. Ever since, its leaders have claimed sovereignty over what they deem Israel's ''united capital.'' But the Palestinians demand East Jerusalem as the capital of their future independent state. They and much of the world see the developments that Israel has built in the annexed area since 1967, now home to some 200,000 Jews, as illegal settlements. These would remain within Israeli Jerusalem under the plan. The vast majority of the city's 300,000 Arab residents -- about a third of Jerusalem's population -- chose not to apply for Israeli citizenship, but hold permanent residency status that entitles them to social benefits and to work and move freely throughout Israel. International road maps for peace have long imagined Palestinian control of Jerusalem's Arab areas and Israeli control of Jewish ones, with a special arrangement for the Old City and its surroundings. But this latest plan -- which would remove about two-thirds of Jerusalem's Arab residents by disconnecting populous outer neighborhoods like Beit Hanina, Sur Baher and Issawiya from the city -- comes in the absence of peace talks and amid months of rising violence. ''We have to open a public debate and a parliamentary debate: What is it we want to keep?'' said Shaul Arieli, a map specialist who took part in past peace talks and helped formulate the plan. Advancing a unilateral plan for Jerusalem as an interim measure, in the absence of talks for a permanent deal, he said, ''shows the Israelis that nothing is holy.'' Mr. Arieli, a reserve colonel in the Israeli Army who participated in the 2000 Camp David negotiations, is among more than 30 Israeli public figures -- veterans of the political, diplomatic and security establishments -- who signed the campaign ads. Haim Ramon, a former minister from Labor and the centrist Kadima Party who is the architect of the new plan, said that if the Arab residents ended their boycott of city elections, the next mayor of Jerusalem would not be Jewish. ''If the Palestinians were clever, they would decide, instead of the knife, to use the vote,'' he told reporters. ''You cannot have a strategy that your enemy will be stupid forever.'' The long impasse in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has given impetus to various Israeli proposals for unilateralism, usually involving withdrawal from part of the West Bank. Such plans, calling for Israel to control its own destiny by defining its borders, aim to satisfy a majority of Israeli Jews, who want some kind of partition but do not believe that a full peace deal is attainable at present. They imagine that removing some settlements and reducing the amount of West Bank territory under occupation could take some international pressure off Israel. But Mr. Ramon's idea of shedding parts of East Jerusalem is causing confusion, even among supporters of other unilateral initiatives meant to hasten the two-state solution. ''Demographically, it's a compelling argument,'' said Michael Oren, a center-right member of Parliament who has proposed his own interim measures involving withdrawal from some settlements. ''Israel has a strategic interest in maintaining a Jewish majority in the capital of the Jewish state.'' But, Mr. Oren added, ''keep in mind that redefining who is a Jerusalemite is not the only way of addressing that.'' Instead, he suggested, a government push to create jobs and lower municipal taxes could encourage more Israeli Jews to move to Jerusalem. The Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem generally have a higher standard of living than those in the West Bank or Gaza Strip. But about three-quarters of Arab families in Jerusalem are below Israel's poverty line, compared with about 21 percent of the city's Jewish families. Many of the Arab residents complain of years of neglect by both City Hall and the Palestinian Authority, which is headquartered in the West Bank and is barred from operating in Jerusalem. Unilaterally disenfranchising the Palestinian residents would require a majority vote of the Israeli Parliament to amend the basic law governing Israel's hold over the city. For the Israeli right, Jerusalem has long posed a conundrum, pitting security and demographic concerns against ideology. When a wave of Palestinian stabbings began in October, the government erected concrete barriers between some Jewish and Arab parts of East Jerusalem to improve security. But after several right-wing ministers complained that the roadblocks suggested the united capital could be divided, just as the Palestinian leadership had been advocating for years, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu abruptly ordered them removed. Mr. Netanyahu and Nir Barkat, Jerusalem's mayor, argue that Israeli sovereignty guarantees the Arab residents a quality of life superior to that of Israel's Arab neighbors. Naftali Bennett, the right-wing education minister, has declared the next school year ''the year of united Jerusalem'' to mark the 50th anniversary of the reunification of the city in 1967. Part of Mr. Bennett's plan is to increase school trips to Jerusalem from across the country. Proponents of the ''Saving Jewish Jerusalem'' campaign noted wryly that the schoolchildren were unlikely to be taken to Sur Baher or Issawiya, where few Israeli Jews dare venture these days. As Mr. Ramon put it, ''Nobody would think to go to these places.''  URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/world/middleeast/new-proposal-to-divide-jerusa lem-unites-people-against-it.html"

The Islamic State took responsibility for the fiery blast in a message on the Amaaq website, which is affiliated with the extremist group, and in a Twitter post. ''The battle has just started and the coming will be worst,'' the Twitter post said. Ali al-Hamdani, who owns a restaurant less than 350 feet from the checkpoint, said, ''I felt an earthquake when the car exploded.'' He added, ''I immediately lay on the ground and saw flames all over the checkpoint.'' Mr. Hamdani, 54, said that he had then stood up ''to check on my friends who sell tea near the checkpoint,'' and that ''one of them was beheaded and others were killed.'' Um Zahra, 32, a teacher, had been on her way to work in a minibus when the attack occurred around 12:30 p.m. ''People were trying to evacuate injured people and burned bodies,'' she said. ''It was a very hard scene.'' According to the authorities, the driver tried to enter Hilla -- the capital of Babylon Province, about 70 miles south of Baghdad -- but was stopped at the checkpoint. He then drove forward and detonated his explosives, which shredded the truck and engulfed other vehicles at the checkpoint in flames. The dead included many of the security officers who operated the checkpoint, the authorities said. ''We have had information about it, but the security forces at the checkpoint weren't qualified enough to deal with it properly,'' said Falah Abdul Kareem, the head of the security and defense committee in Babylon Province. In 2014, a similar attack killed more than 70 people and injured 150 at the checkpoint, known as the Artifacts Checkpoint. The checkpoint was renovated with concrete barriers after that attack and provided with sonar devices to better detect hidden explosives. Some of the security personnel were trained to spot possible insurgents. Gen. Ali al-Zughaibi, the provincial police commander, said that the staff members at the checkpoint had become suspicious of the driver, but that he had started driving again, aiming for a crowd and moving too fast for the officers to stop him. As it has suffered defeats at the hands of Iraq's armed forces, the Islamic State has struck in supposedly safe civilian areas. On Saturday, Brett McGurk, President Obama's envoy to the coalition fighting the Islamic State, said at a news conference in Baghdad that the Islamic State was losing the battle with forces aligned against it in both Iraq and Syria, and that the coalition's focus would turn to stabilizing cities seized from the group.

70,The New York Times,7-Mar-16,Art as Collateral in a Fickle Market,The International New York Times,,"LONDON, ENGLAND (89%)",By SCOTT REYBURN,ENGLISH,,,,Section ; Column 0; The Arts/Cultural Desk; Pg.,,Newspaper,,,1204 words,,7-Mar-16,"NAICS523120 SECURITIES BROKERAGE (58%); NAICS522210 CREDIT CARD ISSUING (58%); NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING (58%); NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES (57%); SIC6799 INVESTORS, NEC (57%)",,CITIGROUP INC (58%); CARLYLE GROUP LP (57%),PRIVATE EQUITY (89%); BANKING & FINANCE (89%); LEVERAGED BUYOUTS (89%); BUYINS & BUYOUTS (89%); WEALTHY PEOPLE (89%); PAINTING (78%); SCULPTURE (78%); PRICES (78%); VISUAL ARTISTS (78%); PRIVATE BANKING (76%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (76%); CAPITAL GAINS TAX (73%); AFFLUENT MARKET (71%); INTERVIEWS (71%); PHOTOGRAPHY SERVICES (71%); ESTATE TAX (69%); INTEREST RATES (60%); ECONOMIC NEWS (60%); EXECUTIVES (50%),"LONDON -- Art and money have long been closely linked, but in the 21st century, it seems, the two have become synonymous. One way to extract the latter from the former is art-based lending, in which paintings or sculptures are used as collateral for loans. Now that the notoriously fickle and opaque art market is seemingly headed toward a downturn, with money tighter and the prices of many artworks lower, will this kind of niche financing become more attractive to collectors? Carlyle Group, the private-equity behemoth, certainly thinks so. In October, the company started Athena Art Finance Corporation, a collaboration with Banque Pictet that would use $280 million of Carlyle equity to enable owners of high-end art to tap the liquidity of their collections. Crucially, Athena is offering nonrecourse loans, exclusively secured by art works rather than other assets. Those loans can be attractive to borrowers, because the lender can lay claim only to the art in the event of a default. Art lenders who have offered full-recourse loans, secured by a range of personal assets, have faced unfavorable publicity. During the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the photographer Annie Leibovitz pledged her four homes and the rights to her images to secure a $24 million loan from Art Capital. She was unable to service the debt, and a high-profile court action ensued. ''This is an opportunity,'' Andrea Danese, a co-founder of Athena and the company's chief executive, said in a telephone interview. Mr. Danese said there was potentially about $150 billion worth of art in private hands that could be collateralized. He identified three groups to whom his company's products might appeal. ''First, there are billionaires who put the money into private equity deals, where they make 20 to 25 percent,'' he said. ''Then there are collectors with, say, $30 million of art they leverage to buy another piece. And thirdly there are the art-rich and cash-poor in their 70s and 80s who don't want to sell because of capital gains or estate taxes.'' Athena offers loans of at least $1 million over six months to seven years based on a maximum of 50 percent of the low valuation of a collection or artwork. It typically charges annual interest of 7 to 9 percent, including origination fees. Athena is just one of two big self-financed lenders offering nonrecourse loans secured by art. Falcon Fine Art in London is the other. Since opening in January 2015, Falcon has arranged about $50 million in loans against high-value artworks, again at annual interest rates of about 7 to 9 percent. Larger banks, even those with art advisory facilities like Citi Private Bank, offer full-recourse loans to wealthy clients for as little as 2.5 to 3 percent a year, said Paul Ress, the managing director of the art lender Right Capital in London. ''Art lending is quite limited because of the affordability conundrum,'' he said. ''If you're a high-net-worth individual, you don't need to use art solely as collateral for a loan.'' But art lenders, like pawnbrokers, can get a boost when markets dip. On Monday in New York, the evening session of Phillips's ''New Now'' auction of contemporary art, designed to kick-start the week of the Armory Show, contained a meager 23 lots, 13 of which managed to sell, raising just $1.7 million. The only work that was sold significantly above its estimate was a 1983 Jean-Michel Basquiat drawing of a snarling dog's head, estimated at $80,000 to $120,000, which drew the night's top price of $257,000. ''There is a process of attrition at the moment. It's cyclical, and it's healthy for the market,'' said the Los Angeles entrepreneur Carlos Rivera, the founder of Art Rank, a website that uses algorithms to analyze contemporary artists as stocks to be bought, held or sold. Mr. Rivera has a new venture, Levart, that -- much like the new-age pawnbrokers Borro -- aims to provide liquidity at a much lower level of the market than Athena. Levart says it can provide nonrecourse financing within 12 hours, if backed by suitable contemporary works valued at as little as $5,000. The monthly interest is a hefty 4 percent for loans under $250,000. But that has not deterred art insiders from using the site to finance profitable short-term resales. Levart cites, for example, the $20,000 borrowed by a client to buy ''Newz!,'' a 2014 painting by the Los Angeles artist Math Bass. The work was then sold at Phillips in November for $81,250 against a low estimate of $25,000, reflecting the original purchase price. If the market does take a serious dip, lenders believe they can play a role in preventing a fire sale. ''People don't want to sell when things are going down in value,'' said Tim Hunter, the vice president of Falcon Fine Art, ''but they might need to take liquidity out of their collection.'' Wealthy art buyers certainly took plenty of liquidity out of their collections last year at Sotheby's. Throughout 2015, the auction house's finance division had an average of $733 million of full-recourse loans on its books, generating $65 million of income, according to fourth-quarter results released on Feb. 26. Those figures might not seem much compared to the company's $6 billion in auction sales, but Sotheby's 2015 auction commissions of $719 million were 5 percent less than in 2014, while income from financing rose 38 percent. For many, art collecting today is all about maximizing returns on an investment portfolio. But an auction in France last month is a reminder of the premium buyers place on collections put together without commercial considerations. On Feb. 22 and 23, the Paris auctioneer Artcurial sold the collection of Pierre Hebey, a French intellectual property lawyer who died last year at 89. The sale raised 8.9 million euros, about $9.8 million, well above the estimate of ?6 million, with 85 percent of the 564 lots sold. Top price was the ?845,000 paid for Roberto Matta's 1938 surrealist painting ''Morphologie Psychologique de l'Angoisse.'' Hebey, who counted Max Ernst and Marc Chagall among his friends, had been well-positioned to acquire 20th century art. But he was also a lifelong collector of Art Deco, 19th-century bronzes and other antiques, and he could often be found at flea markets around Paris, flashlight in hand, at five in the morning. One of his most striking purchases was Emmanuel Frémiet's gilded bronze sculpture ''Pélican Gastronome,'' showing the bird feeding its chicks, commissioned in 1890 by the president of the Banque de France. The Petit Palais museum in Paris bought the work at the Artcurial auction for ?76,200. Fabien Naudan, the vice president of Artcurial, explained why he thought buyers were so eager to bid at the Hebey sale. ''They were trying to buy part of his life,'' said Mr. Naudan, who added that Mr. Hebey was motivated as a collector solely by his love of an object. ''People are ready to pay much more for this 'charge émotionnelle.''' How much? ''Maybe 20 percent,'' Mr. Naudan suggested. The financial industry sometimes classifies art as an ''investment of passion.'' Paradoxically, passion, rather than portfolio planning, seems to be the thing that ensures above-average financial returns.

71,The New York Times,7-Mar-16,Leicester Accepts Its Dream May Be Real,The International New York Times,,"LONDON, ENGLAND (74%)",By ROB HUGHES,ENGLISH,,,,Section ; Column 0; Sports Desk; GLOBAL SOCCER; Pg.,,Newspaper,,,927 words,,7-Mar-16,NAICS711211 SPORTS TEAMS & CLUBS (50%); SIC7941 PROFESSIONAL SPORTS CLUBS & PROMOTERS (50%),,MANCHESTER UNITED PLC (50%),ATHLETES (89%); SOCCER (89%); CITY GOVERNMENT (78%); SPORTS (75%); SPORTS & RECREATION (75%),"LONDON -- ''The title is not ours,'' said Leicester City Manager Claudio Ranieri. ''Something special can happen, but we have to fight a lot, slowly, slowly.'' Those cautious words, said on television after Leicester's latest win at Watford on Saturday, contained for the first time an acknowledgement from this wily old coach that the seemingly impossible could happen. Ranieri has been in denial throughout this remarkable season. His mantra has been that the Foxes are a small club running just to survive and that he has been expecting them to be chased down by the pack, led by Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal and Manchester City. He is right, to the extent that it is still an implausible dream that a club the size of Leicester ever could win the Premiership. Yet with nine games remaining after this weekend, and with the Foxes five points ahead of their closest rival, the chasers are beginning to run out of games to reel Leicester in. ''A lot can happen,'' insisted Leicester's goalkeeper, Kasper Schmeichel. ''In nine games last season, we saved ourselves in this league.'' Indeed, they did. The team was fighting to stay in the Premier League a year ago, and it barely changed over the summer. Now it is running to win the title for the first time. Typical of what Leicester has done all season, Saturday's victory was full of hard work and tenacious synchronicity between defense, midfield and attack. The 1-0 win at Watford was topped off by the magic of Riyad Mahrez, who was bought for little more than half a million dollars from the French second division team Le Havre in early 2014. Mahrez struck the only goal of the game from the edge of the penalty box after 56 minutes. There were opponents in front of him, to his left and to his right, but when the ball came his way after Watford tried to head out a clearance, the Algerian took one touch to control it and a second to guide the ball into the roof of the net, beyond the reach of Watford goalie Heurelho Gomes. Mahrez is so slight a figure that you have to marvel at the power, speed and precision with which he can strike a ball. It was his 15th goal of this season, and he has assisted on 11 others, many of them for his running mate, Jamie Vardy. They make quite a combination: the fierce, fast tenacity of Vardy along with the subtlety of Mahrez. Leicester paid peanuts for them, compared with what Manchester City, Chelsea, Manchester United or Arsenal shell out for top players. While Leicester keeps winning, with a place in next season's Champions League almost assured, most of the others are floundering. Manchester City won easily enough Saturday with a merciless 4-0 drubbing of Aston Villa, a team that appears already resigned to its fate of relegation. Villa, a bigger club than Leicester when it comes to both tradition and finances, has become so badly run, from top to bottom, that it has lost any semblance of fight. By the end in Manchester, it simply became a question of counting how many goals City would score. But City is 10 points behind Leicester and has tougher games ahead. Tottenham and Arsenal, the not-so-neighborly North London neighbors, lie in second and third place. They fought each other to a 2-2 standstill at the Spurs' White Hart Lane Stadium on Saturday. The highlights of that game were above what Leicester generally can achieve, but both sides lacked the defensive stability, unity and hunger shown by the Foxes. Arsenal scored first through a brilliantly improvised back heel by Aaron Ramsey. But after halftime, Arsenal lost a man, and with it control of the derby match. The culprit was Francis Coquelin, who is as close to being an artisan as Arsenal has ever fielded. His job is to win the ball in midfield and give Arsenal some cover in front of a shaky defense, especially on a days like Saturday, when it lacked the security of its first-string goalkeeper, Petr Cech. Early on, Coquelin received a yellow card for a blatant handball. ''We told him at half time to be careful,'' said Arsenal Manager Arsène Wenger. ''The regret of the day was that we lost control when Coquelin was sent off. He deserved to go, I cannot deny that.'' No one could. Coquelin's second yellow was for a late and high foul on Harry Kane 10 minutes into the second half. It was a tackle that was completely unnecessary because Kane, out on the sideline, was running nowhere with the ball. After that irresponsible foul, Spurs took command. Defender Toby Alderweireld scored after a Tottenham corner kick, and two minutes later Kane curled in a beauty from the left edge of the penalty area. Arsenal came back, thanks to the passing and movement the team is known for, and it tied the score at 2-2 through a goal by Alexis Sánchez. A tie, though, serves neither Arsenal nor Tottenham well, because the team above them, Leicester, would not settle for just one point. Ranieri can make all the denials he wants, but in the locker room he must be humming a different tune. Leicester's strength has been continuity in its lineups, but every once in a while, Ranieri will throw a tactical switch to utilize what he has learned in his 30 years of management. After halftime on Saturday, he took off striker Shinji Okazaki and winger Marc Albrighton and inserted Andy King and Jeff Schlupp to match up with Watford's congested five man-midfield. It worked, and quickly. Leicester took the game away from Watford, and the chase to the title was on. ''I don't know who is behind us,'' concluded Ranieri. ''I want to run, very, very fast to the line.''  URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/sports/soccer/leicester-accepts-its-dream-may- be-real.html"

This is a catastrophe that will soon become far worse as warm weather swells the torrent of people fleeing war in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. With the European Union incapable of united action, country after country has imposed panicky controls on once-open borders to block the refugees. On Monday, Macedonian police fired volleys of tear gas at asylum seekers who burst through a fence on the Greece-Macedonia border. The same day, France began clearing out ''the Jungle,'' an enclave near Calais with thousands of refugees waiting desperately to cross the English Channel into Britain. And as gates across Europe close to them, thousands upon thousands of people crowd into Greece, which is opening a new camp nearly every day. A report by Liz Alderman of The Times, about the desperate efforts of Greece to feed and house refugees expected to soon number 100,000, is heart-wrenching in its description of the wretched conditions of refugees and of the extraordinary efforts of the Greeks to help them. Greece cannot shoulder Europe's burden on its own. Then there is the threat to the whole concept of an open Europe. Last month, Austria joined with nine Balkan states to impose a tough border policy, in the process inexplicably reclassifying Afghans as economic migrants rather than refugees and therefore barred from entry. Four East European countries, led by Poland and Hungary, have likewise joined to block refugees, undermining the united Europe they dreamed of while in Soviet captivity. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who from the outset of the crisis has urged pan-European action and has opened her country's doors the widest to refugees, is increasingly a lone voice of leadership and reason. Europe must move now to end the ad hoc anti-refugee alliances and forge a common and humane policy, including urgent help for Greece. And the United States must become an active partner in this effort. The pleas of people seeking safety are a challenge not just to Europe but to all countries with a conscience.

Sometime between 10:00 and 11:00 last Monday morning firemen who had put out a blaze in an apartment in a large building discovered the body of a toddler among the debris. The child had been beheaded. A short time later, a woman dressed in black was seen at a nearby subway station. She was screaming, ''Allahu akbar! I am a terrorist! I hate democracy! I will blow all of you up!'' She was brandishing the severed head of a child. According to various news accounts, the grizzly scene stretched out for a while, perhaps as long as 40 minutes. Police finally apprehended the woman. She was identified as Gulchekhra Bobokulova, a 38-year-old woman from the Central Asian country Uzbekistan, a former Soviet republic. In the afternoon and evening, scant details emerged, breaking the heart further. The dead child was a four-year-old girl. She had been injured at birth and was developmentally delayed. Her parents had struggled to give her the best available care and education: Russia is a society where special-needs children are often ignored. The couple had one other child. They also had a Chihuahua, and it was now missing. The girl apparently was beheaded before the apartment was set on fire. The parents had left their home just a short time earlier, leaving their daughter in the care of Ms. Bobokulova, who had been working for the family for 18 months. How does one tell a story like this, one that brings together every worst fear and can reinforce every worst prejudice? A few people made early attempts. Several Russian bloggers pointed out that hundreds of Russian children die of abuse every year. These cases include a one-year-old thrown out a ninth-floor window in Moscow in January, apparently by parents who wanted to drink without distraction. In February, a seven-year-old was killed by his mother in Tomsk, ostensibly because he was not doing his homework. Russia has a children's rights ombudsman, and he looked at things from a different angle. He hinted that the parents were to blame, tweeting: ''When hiring a nanny for your child, you should at least make sure that she is mentally healthy, demand a note from a psychiatrist and a medical exam!'' There was also the perspective of the president's Civic Council, the Kremlin's overseer of all ostensibly unofficial activity, which suggested honoring the police officers who had apprehended the nanny -- even as bloggers raged about how long it took them. The story seemed to offer so many possibilities for Russian television, which has raised hatred and fear-mongering to an art form. It was a unique chance to play up the fear of migrants, whom Russians, and Muscovites especially, love to blame for all their ills. You could also tap the fear of terrorism, specifically the fear of black-clad women wearing hijabs threatening to blow themselves up, as the woman had been: Such women have figured or have been said to figure in several terrifying terrorist attacks in Moscow. Then the murder raised the need to protect children, the central unifying theme of all Russian propaganda. All three motifs could even be combined, as Russian television has sometimes done with gusto, for example when reporting a recent story of a Russian-German girl who said she had been kidnapped and raped by migrants in Berlin. The story turned out to be fabricated. What would Russian TV do with this story? Which of the many narratives would it choose? Which political message would it bring to the forefront? None. None of the Russian broadcast channels said a word about the gruesome murder or the woman who had terrorized a neighborhood walking around with the severed head of a child, or the pilgrimage that followed to the place where she was detained, where people came to lay hundreds of flowers and stuffed animals. The Russian news site RBK reported that the channels had been instructed to omit the story. The only possible source of such instructions -- the Kremlin -- denied those reports. President Vladimir V. Putin's press secretary, Dmitry S. Peskov, claimed that each television channel had made the decision independently. The Kremlin just happened to think it was the right decision. Some stories are just too terrible to tell. When you have perfectly obedient media willing to speak with a single voice, you have the luxury of eliding such stories. Moscow's most experienced propagandist is Vladimir Posner. Western television viewers may remember him as the talking head who defended the Soviet Union in perfect English back in the 1980s. Mr. Posner issued a statement in support of the decision not to report the severed-head story. ''Why show it? What's the point? What for?'' These are telling questions. Russian journalists loyal to the Kremlin, like the Russian government, view the media as a propaganda vehicle. When they consider running a story, they think primarily about the impact it would have. What was the impact of those copious reports on the rape that never happened in Berlin? In the mind of propagandists, it served to inflame anti-Western sentiment in Russia and anti-refugee sentiment in Germany. In their imagination -- and perhaps only there -- those kinds of stories wreak havoc in European societies. Propagandists don't want to wreak havoc in Russia, and that's enough to keep the severed-head story off TV screens. It doesn't occur to Russian television executives that their job is to report what happens.

75,The New York Times,7-Mar-16,Review: 'Hungry' Portrays a Mourning Clan in Election Year 2016,The New York Times on the Web,,,By BEN BRANTLEY,ENGLISH,Review,,UNITED STATES (79%),Section ; Column 0; The Arts/Cultural Desk; Pg.,"NEW YORK, USA (79%)",Newspaper,,,945 words,,7-Mar-16,,,,THEATER & DRAMA (91%); THEATER (90%); DRAMA LITERATURE (89%); THEATER REVIEWS (89%); STARVATION (78%); ELECTIONS (72%); WRITERS (72%); US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS (70%); PUBLIC POLICY (65%); HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS (65%),"As befits a work with the title ''Hungry,'' food is prepared -- ardently and aromatically -- in the wonderful new play written and directed by Richard Nelson, which opened on Friday night at the Public Theater. Yet it is unlikely that the ratatouille and apple crumble on offer will satisfy the appetites of the five women and one man assembled in a snug kitchen in Rhinebeck, N.Y. The hunger being experienced here, which pervades this exquisitely acted production like scents from a laden stove, can't be assuaged by second helpings. Though they are hardly poor or homeless, the inhabitants of Mr. Nelson's latest offering are still starved -- for stability, a promise that they aren't alone and the reassurance that the familiar town and country in which they have lived for so many years isn't disappearing as they speak. As you may have surmised, these people, who share the last name of Gabriel, have a lot in common with much of the American electorate in 2016. And ''Hungry,'' a work in which nothing much happens beyond some contemplative pre-dinner chatter, may well be the most resonantly topical and emotionally engaging play of this presidential election year. Hungry might also be said to describe the state in which Mr. Nelson left New York theatergoers at the end of 2013. That was when the final installment of Mr. Nelson's four-part cycle ''The Apple Family Plays'' came to its conclusion. I don't think I was alone in feeling bereft of what had come to feel like a deeply personal relationship. Featuring many of the same cast members, these were works for the Age of Obama in which the talk flowed seamlessly from private losses to public policy. If the last of the tetralogy, ''Regular Singing,'' felt slightly more contrived than the others, I was still sorry to say goodbye to a family who somehow turned casual conversation into theatrical catharsis. Now Mr. Nelson has invited us to meet the Gabriels, and I promise they're equally good company. Like the Apples, they're good talkers, by which I mean eloquent without being unnaturally articulate. But though two of them are portrayed by performers who were in the Apple plays (the invaluable Maryann Plunkett and Jay O. Sanders), the Gabriels are definitely not the Apples under another name. They think of themselves as more marginal socially than their predecessors did; they're more scared and more defensive, being longtime middle-class residents of a village that has suddenly become a fashionable bedroom community of the very rich. The focal point of ''Hungry'' is a dramatist of some renown, Thomas Gabriel, who has been dead for several months when the play begins. March 4, 2016, is the day his family has agreed to meet to distribute his ashes in the Hudson River. Thomas's brother, George (Mr. Sanders), is there, with his wife, Hannah (Lynn Hawley), and his sister, Joyce (Amy Warren); so is Thomas's fractious mother, Patricia (Roberta Maxwell). Then there are Thomas's wives: Karin (Meg Gibson), an actress to whom he was once married, an unexpected arrival today, and Mary (the emotionally translucent Ms. Plunkett), Thomas's widow and the play's beating heart. Their bereavement is no longer raw but has settled into that persistent throb of awareness of a gaping and permanent vacuum. It's the perfect state of mind in which to contemplate the corrosive effects of time and the sense of things, big and small, coming to an end. That includes life as the Gabriels used to know it in Rhinebeck. There is much talk about the mores and language of the rich, who it would seem are increasingly controlling not just this town, but the world. The forthcoming elections are also on everyone's mind, and particularly Hillary Clinton, whom they regard with an ambivalent hopefulness as the first potential female president. Characters read from old cookbooks,that offer glimpses into lives once lived by American women, which sometimes uneasily parallel their own. Such conversation is never dry debate. Mr. Nelson finds the weave of momentous history in the fabric of the quotidian. These works are as personal as they are political, and you cannot separate the two any more than you can in your own life. At one point, Hannah offers an affecting appraisal of the United States at this moment: It feels, she says, as if ''we're all just watching this movie where there are recognizable 'pieces' of things but put together in ways so they seem -- very strange. Don't you feel something really bad is going to happen?'' A lot of us know that feeling. Thank heavens we have the comfort of knowing that Mr. Nelson has promised that the Gabriels will be showing up at the Public two more times before this year ends, including on election night. Being afraid is always easier, after all, when you know you're not alone.

77,The New York Times,7-Mar-16,"Wary of Prying Eyes Online, a Home Tour Calls It Quits",Late Edition - Final,,,By SARAH MASLIN NIR,ENGLISH,,,,Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 14,,Newspaper,,,1053 words,"PHOTO: Judy Stanton, a former executive director of the Brooklyn Heights Association, has been involved with a tour of homes in the neighborhood for three decades. The tour is ending amid concerns about online exposure.

What homey perfection hides behind each cornice and gable, bay window and ornate lintel? How much more resplendent are the lives inside those buildings than in our own apartments? For 31 years the Brooklyn Heights Association has provided some answers by offering a tour of private residences in the neighborhood that, for one day, allowed the curious up the stoops and into the living rooms that are often every bit as palatial as imagined. But after three decades, the association has called it quits on the tour: a victim, organizers say, of the times -- in particular, of Google. ''The people who put their house on the tour, it's an unbelievable act of generosity, for which they get no credit in a funny way, because it is anonymous'' to protect privacy, said Erika Belsey Worth, a vice president of the Brooklyn Heights Association. ''Now you look at the address -- you look it up, you find out everything,'' she said, adding, ''It's just an invasion of privacy in the way that it wasn't 30 years ago.'' Or as the group's treasurer, Daniel Watts, put it at the association's annual meeting in this month, according to The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, which first reported the tour's end: ''The house tour is a victim of the modern world.'' The issue, in part, is a fear of exposure. The houses, some with stained-glass detailing, parquet flooring, marble countertops and settees with throw pillows arranged just so, could seem too Pinterest-worthy for a visitor to resist taking a photograph, association members said. The tour, which was usually held in May, typically consisted of five private homes, all volunteered by owners whose names were not published in the tour's program. Tickets were $40 in recent years -- though last year the price was doubled in an effort to keep numbers down. Although the tour was a significant part of its fund-raising strategy, the association says it is currently planning an event to rival the tour. The organization had rules to protect the homeowners: no photographs and no children except babies, and even then, only in ''front packs,'' according to its website. Volunteers were stationed in each room and on landings between floors, not only to ward against visitors' tripping on a rumpled runner, but also to monitor for forbidden photo-taking. As far as the association knows, photos of the interiors of homes on the tour have not appeared on the Internet. But with the ubiquity of camera phones, surreptitious photography is harder to spot, Ms. Worth said. ''You don't even have to look through the viewfinder,'' she said. It would be impossible to know, for example, whether visitors had their phone aloft beside that wrought-iron mantelpiece because they were innocently composing a text message or because they were posting a photo of the fireplace to Twitter. So far, the worst thing that has occurred in the tour's history, according to Judy Stanton, a former executive director of the association who has been involved with the tour for three decades, was when a woman tripped down a staircase and dislocated a shoulder a few years ago. Even after the woman was taken away in an ambulance and the house was removed from the itinerary for the rest of the day's event, the tour marched on, Ms. Stanton said. But it is the mere specter of exposure on Instagram and in other corners of the Internet, not whether such a thing has actually happened, that has scared people away from volunteering their homes for the tour. ''It's a strange kind of privacy concern that people have because on the one hand, they are active in social media, in ways that I don't think are at all private, and then they don't want people inside,'' said Ms. Stanton, who put her house on the first official tour in 1985, when her children were little. ''I am of the generation that rings the doorbell for a cup of sugar,'' she said, adding, ''I don't see that kind of culture prevailing in 2016.'' Real estate websites like StreetEasy and Trulia have made it relatively simple to search for a home's sale price, floor plans and even its owner's identity, which may have turned off new participants, said John MacIntosh, who runs an investment bank that serves nonprofits and volunteered his house for the tour in the past. Visitors ''see the books you read, and they see the bed you sleep on, and I think that people are fine with that,'' he said. ''But I guess they are less fine about people knowing who they are in a LinkedIn, Internet, social media sort of world.'' For some homeowners, the possibility of widespread social media exposure prompted concerns that their homes would become easy targets for burglars. Yet organizers of house tours in other parts of New York City say they have not heard the same concerns raised that led to the demise of the Brooklyn Heights tour, offering explanations with a whiff of neighborhood rivalry. ''They go for the higher-end public, large-scale houses, in terms of celebrities, that sort of thing,'' said Gilly Youner, an architect and co-president of the Park Slope Civic Council. In her Brooklyn neighborhood, there has been a house tour for twice as long, she said, which tends to attract older people. ''I think that the demographic that comes to see ours is not a social media demographic. And then there's a lot of local Park Slopers who don't really feel like they want to tweet or post about our neighbors.'' Gina B. Ramcharan, the president of the Mount Morris Park Community Improvement Association, says she sometimes has difficulty recruiting homeowners for the home tour in her Harlem neighborhood because of a surplus of modesty, not a fear of being exposed. ''A lot of it is, 'Oh my God, I have to clean up my house!''' she said. ''Or, 'I don't think my house is worthy for the tour,' because they're thinking it has to be Architectural Digest-ready.'' The act of touring a private home seems, by definition, an invasion of privacy, albeit a sanctioned one. For Ms. Ramcharan, a small-business consultant, the tours are an act of sharing. ''If you saw some of the detail, the original mantles, it is really something to stand up and be proud about,'' she said. ''So I can't understand someone being apprehensive about taking photos.''

78,The New York Times,7-Mar-16,What You Missed in the Debate,The New York Times on the Web,,"FLINT, MI, USA (88%)",By ASHLEY PARKER,ENGLISH,,,UNITED STATES (94%),Section ; Column 0; Politics; Pg.,"MICHIGAN, USA (94%); MAINE, USA (92%)",Newspaper,,HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (92%); BERNIE SANDERS (92%); RICK SNYDER (56%),977 words,,7-Mar-16,,,,POLITICAL PARTIES (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (90%); POLITICAL DEBATES (90%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (90%); WATER CRISES & SHORTAGES (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); CAUCUSES (78%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (78%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (78%); POLITICS (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (76%); GOVERNORS (72%); CONSERVATION (71%); BANKING & FINANCE (66%); TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (66%); AGREEMENTS (50%),"Here's how we analyzed the Democratic debate. Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont faced off yet again Sunday night, after a weekend of voting where both Democrats notched wins. Mr. Sanders won the Maine Democratic caucuses, according to The Associated Press. The debate, hosted by CNN, took place in Flint, Mich., a town facing a drinking water crisis, in a state where voters head to the polls on Tuesday that will prove a crucial test for both candidates. Anderson Cooper, the debate moderator, kicked off the night by explaining why CNN had chosen to stage its latest debate in Flint, Mich. The city is ''in crisis,'' he said, and the water ''is toxic.'' Both Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton also paid homage to Flint in their minute-long opening statements, calling for the state's governor, Rick Snyder, to resign. Mr. Sanders called the situation in Flint ''a dereliction of duty,'' and Mrs. Clinton said she planned to ''continue to shine a very bright spotlight on what has happened in this city.'' Mrs. Clinton declined to say if the head of the Environmental Protection Agency should be fired, saying she didn't know how high up the chain the problem went. But both she and Mr. Sanders said whoever was responsible for the crisis should absolutely be relieved of their job. The water crisis in Flint dominated the first 20 minutes of the debate, with every question (and follow-up) focusing on some aspect of the tragedy. The first question not about the water maintained focus on the community, with a voter asking what Mrs. Clinton would do to keep jobs from being sent overseas. The first heated moment came after Mrs. Clinton talked about her efforts to stop jobs from going overseas. ''I am very glad that secretary Clinton has discovered religion on this issue, but it's a little bit too late,'' Mr. Sanders said, arguing that his rival had supported many ''disastrous trade agreements.'' Mrs. Clinton countered by pointing out that Mr. Sanders had opposed the auto bailout -- a key issue for Michigan, with its reliance on the auto industry, and one that she had supported. The two candidates also tussled over the speeches Mrs. Clinton gave to banking groups. Mr. Sanders said ''if you get paid a couple hundred thousand dollars for a speech, it must be a great speech -- I think we should release it.'' Mrs. Clinton said she would be happy to release transcripts of her speeches, assuming her potential opponents did the same. ''I'll release it! Here it is!'' Mr. Sanders said, throwing up his hands and prompting chuckles. ''There ain't nothing! I don't give speeches to Wall Street!'' Mrs. Clinton used an emotional question on gun violence -- from a father whose daughter was recently injured in a shooting spree -- to highlight a key difference between herself and Mr. Sanders: Her vote against giving immunity to gun manufacturers. Mr. Sanders argued that he has a D-minus rating from the N.R.A., but still stands by his position, saying that what Mrs. Clinton is suggesting is ''ending gun manufacturing in America. I don't agree with that.'' As the exchange grew increasingly heated, Mrs. Clinton ended by evoking the children who were killed in the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, to applause. ''You're not the only person whose heart was broken,'' Mr. Sanders said. Mr. Sanders, who has struggled with minority voters, was asked to talk about personal experiences that have helped him understand the ''mind-set and values of other cultures.'' The Vermont senator discussed how, as a student at the University of Chicago, he had worked with his fellow students, black and white, to desegregate housing owned by the university. ''Most candidates running for president usually don't put this on their résumé, but a year later I was arrested by Chicago police for trying to desegregate the Chicago school system,'' he added. Mrs. Clinton, for her part, talked about a meaningful experience she'd had as a young woman working for Marian Wright Edelman, investigating whether schools in Alabama were discriminating based on race. Asked a follow-up question on ''racial blind spots,'' Mrs. Clinton said that as a ''white woman'' in America, there were some experiences she simply hasn't had -- like having ''The Talk'' with your children, about a routine stop by the police that could end in violence. Mr. Sanders recalled visiting the nation's capital with an African-American colleague, only to learn the man refused to hail cabs in Washington, D.C., for fear that as a black man he might be ignored. ''When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto,'' he said, later. On the issue of fracking, Mrs. Clinton said she supported the process only if it were highly regulated. Laying out several conditions, she explained that, ''by the time you get through all of my conditions,'' she doubted there would be much fracking occurring in America. Mr. Sanders offered a slightly more succinct answer: ''My answer is a lot shorter,'' he said. ''No. I do not support fracking.'' Because no debate is complete without the looming presence of Donald J. Trump, one of the final questions was how Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders would take on the real estate billionaire. ''The last time I checked, as of last night, Donald Trump had received 3.6 million votes, which is a good number,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''There's only one candidate in either party who has more votes than him -- and that's me.'' ''Donald Trump's bigotry, his bullying, and his bluster are not going to wear well on the America people,'' she added. Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, offered, ''Sanders versus Trump does a lot better than Clinton versus Trump.''

79,The New York Times,7-Mar-16,Size of Health Care Networks Is to Become More Transparent Next Year,Late Edition - Final,,,By ROBERT PEAR,ENGLISH,,,,Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 9,,Newspaper,,,946 words,,7-Mar-16,,,,HEALTH INSURANCE (91%); HEALTH CARE (90%); INSURANCE (90%); HOSPITALS (90%); PHYSICIANS & SURGEONS (90%); CONSUMER PROTECTION (90%); CONSUMER LAW (89%); US PATIENT PROTECTION & AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (89%); AGENCY RULEMAKING (89%); INSURANCE PREMIUMS (78%); INSURANCE DEDUCTIBLES (78%); CONSUMER WATCHDOGS (78%); INSURANCE COPAYMENTS (78%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); HEALTH CARE POLICY (78%); ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS (78%); MIDDLE INCOME PERSONS (73%); MEDICAL EDUCATION (73%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (73%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (72%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (71%); CHRONIC DISEASES (68%); EXECUTIVES (50%),"WASHINGTON --  The Obama administration, responding to consumer complaints, says it will begin rating health insurance plans based on how many doctors and hospitals they include in their networks. At the same time, the maximum out-of-pocket costs for consumers under the Affordable Care Act will increase next year to $7,150 for an individual and $14,300 for a family, the administration said. Consumer advocates said those costs could be a significant burden for middle-income people who need a substantial amount of care. Under new rules to be published Tuesday in the Federal Register, insurers will still be allowed to sell health plans with narrow networks of providers. But consumers will know in advance what they are getting because the government will attach a label indicating the breadth of the network for each plan sold on HealthCare.gov. About 12.7 million people signed up or had their coverage automatically renewed in the third annual open enrollment season, which ended on Jan. 31. Many health plans offered in the public marketplaces provide a limited choice of doctors and hospitals, and some insurers narrowed their networks this year by excluding some doctors and dropping popular teaching hospitals. Consumers have grumbled about the changes, and some say they have had difficulty finding medical specialists. But cost-conscious consumers have gravitated to these plans because they tend to offer lower premiums than health plans providing a greater choice of doctors and hospitals. Consumers can already find out which health plans include a specific doctor. But until now they had no reliable way to determine if a health plan had a large or small network of providers. The new ratings will indicate how the breadth of a health plan's network compares with that of other plans in the same geographic area. ''This could be really helpful for a lot of consumers,'' said Sabrina Corlette, a consumer advocate and professor at the Health Policy Institute of Georgetown University. Consumers have also complained about the out-of-pocket costs for many health plans under the Affordable Care Act. ''For many people, $7,000 of costs can be a huge impediment to actually receiving care,'' especially if patients incur those costs in a month or two at the start of a year, said Marc M. Boutin, the chief executive of the National Health Council, a coalition of advocacy groups for people with chronic diseases. Out-of-pocket costs, as defined by the government, include deductibles and co-payments, but not the premiums that people pay for insurance. Each insurer sets limits on out-of-pocket costs for its health plans, and the limit cannot be higher than the maximum specified by the government. The maximum for an individual will exceed $7,000 next year for the first time. It will go up by $300 in 2017, after an increase of $250 this year. Consumer groups say this rate of increase is unsustainable. Moreover, they say, high out-of-pocket costs have deterred some people with insurance from using expensive prescription drugs. Ben Wakana, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said that in setting the new ceiling on out-of-pocket costs, the administration had used a formula laid out in the Affordable Care Act. Before the law was adopted, he said, people with cancer or other serious illnesses could be bankrupted by hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills, and the law provides new protections. People with low incomes can obtain discounts that reduce their deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs if they choose midlevel silver plans. Slightly more than half of the people with marketplace coverage received such ''cost-sharing reductions'' last year. Ms. Corlette, the Georgetown University professor, said that in writing the new rules, ''the administration was walking a very delicate line, pushing forward with consumer protections while trying to keep insurers onboard and participating in the marketplaces.'' In some markets, consumers can choose from dozens of health plans. In a move intended to simplify the shopping experience, the Obama administration has devised six model health plans that it describes as standardized options. Federal officials specify the amount of deductibles, co-payments and other charges for doctors' services, hospital care, X-rays, laboratory tests and prescription drugs. The standard features will make it easier for consumers to compare plans, officials said, and the government will highlight these plans in some way on HealthCare.gov. But the government is not requiring insurers to offer the standardized options or limiting their ability to offer other plans in 2017. Another new requirement is meant to guarantee ''continuity of care'' for certain patients. If a health plan drops a doctor from its network without cause, the insurer must allow patients in ''an active course of treatment'' to continue seeing the doctor for up to 90 days. This protection would apply, for example, to patients receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy for cancer and to women in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Under the new rules, consumers using the federal marketplace will be able to get help year-round from insurance counselors financed by the government. The counselors, known as navigators, help people sign up in the annual open enrollment period. The administration is expanding their duties to include teaching people how to use insurance, appeal denials of coverage and obtain exemptions.

Biden Jr. had some tongue-in-cheek advice for President Obama on Saturday about whom he should nominate to fill the Supreme Court vacancy that has preoccupied the White House and incited an election-year fight. Choose Senator Ted Cruz, Mr. Biden joked, referring to the Republican presidential candidate from Texas, who is unpopular with his colleagues. ''Look, I told Barack if you really, really want to remake the Supreme Court, nominate Cruz,'' Mr. Biden said at the annual Gridiron Dinner, according to excerpts from his prepared speech released by his office. ''Before you know it, you'll have eight vacancies.'' It was more than just a humorous dig at Mr. Cruz during the traditional Washington event, where politicians roast themselves in speeches and journalists lampoon them in musical skits. Mr. Biden's remarks hit on the historic stakes facing the president as he ponders his choice to succeed Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last month, leaving Mr. Obama with a chance to fundamentally reshape the nation's highest court by replacing its leading conservative. The Gridiron, whose motto is ''to singe but never burn,'' was once considered strictly off the record; these days, cameras are still banned, but what is said often finds its way into news reports. The White House released transcripts of Mr. Obama's remarks when he spoke there in years past, and Mr. Biden settled on a middle ground this year: His office distributed only excerpts. They included comments defending a 1992 speech -- seized on by Republicans to justify their contention that Mr. Obama has no right to fill the Supreme Court vacancy -- in which Mr. Biden, then the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said a president should not try to name someone to the high court during a presidential election year. ''A lot of you have brought up a clip from a speech I made in 1992,'' Mr. Biden said. ''Look, what can I tell you? That was a different time.'' He went on to describe a political landscape from nearly a quarter-century ago that looks remarkably similar to today. ''A Clinton was at the top of the polls. The Bush dynasty was in trouble. Donald Trump was saying outlandish things,'' Mr. Biden said. ''As I said, a totally different time.'' The vice president defended the speech in a New York Times Op-Ed last week, saying he had not meant it to justify obstruction but to argue for a more consultative Supreme Court nomination process and the selection of a consensus candidate. But on Saturday night, there was little nuance to Mr. Biden's routine. He returned often to his own lingering presidential aspirations, which ended late last year when he decided against a bid for the Democratic nomination, and to speculation that Mr. Obama might nominate himself to fill the Supreme Court vacancy. Mr. Biden took the stage on Saturday to the strains of ''Hail to the Chief,'' the anthem that heralds the president's arrival, and he said, ''God, I love that song.'' ''The other day I walked into the Oval and said, 'Barack, I think you should resign,' '' Mr. Biden told the audience. ''He said, 'To join the Supreme Court?' '' Mr. Biden continued.

On both sides of the debate, many claims collapse under scrutiny. Republicans who want to keep the prison open say only the worst of the worst are left, yet dozens of low-level detainees were approved for transfer years ago and stranded for geopolitical reasons. Republicans insist Guantánamo's military commissions offer tough justice, but those tribunals have been largely dysfunctional. And they cite Bush-era data to say that freed prisoners will join terrorist groups, but the Obama administration has performed more thorough reviews and those it released have been far less likely to cause problems. Yet a key argument Mr. Obama makes for shuttering the prison in Cuba -- that its continued operation is contrary to ''our values'' -- crumbles upon examination, too. His plan for closing it would not eliminate the main human rights complaints, because the United States would still be holding several dozen prisoners in perpetual detention without trial and force-feeding those who go on a hunger strike. It would just do that in a prison on American soil. The loose talk has produced years of politicized stalemate, spotlighted again late last month when Mr. Obama announced with fanfare a plan to close the prison that in reality recycled a plan he has pursued since 2009. Congressional Republicans, who have for years baselessly accused him of having no plan, promptly pronounced it dead on arrival. ''Both the Republicans and the president are significantly exaggerating the threats and harms posed by the other side's positions,'' said Jack Goldsmith, a top Justice Department official in the George W. Bush administration, now at Harvard Law School. ''The moral and national security arguments on both sides mostly serve other agendas -- political advantage for the Republicans, and legacy burnishing for the president.'' To understand how Guantánamo became less a policy dilemma than a charged political symbol not always anchored to facts, it helps to return to some crucial events early in the Obama presidency. In January 2009, the newly inaugurated President Obama ordered his administration to close the prison within a year. Of the nearly 800 detainees held there under President Bush, all but 242 had been transferred overseas. But his task force soon reported bad news: It was likely to designate several dozen detainees as impossible to prosecute for various reasons, but too dangerous to release. Bowing to pragmatism, Mr. Obama decided those detainees would have to remain locked up without trial for the time being. He also accepted the principle that some detainees would be tried by military commission, not in civilian court, in part because the looser military rules of evidence would allow trials for more of those held. From that moment, his plan could no longer be a clarion call to restore a pre-Sept. 11, 2001, understanding of the rule of law and to vindicate human rights. Instead, the administration has offered a hodgepodge of practical considerations, like saving money and rebranding detention to leave behind the toxic image of shackled prisoners in orange jumpsuits from Guantánamo's early years. A Political Hammer Not long after Mr. Obama quietly abandoned his strongest moral argument against the prison, the Republicans discovered its potency as a political hammer. In the 2008 campaign, there was bipartisan consensus that Guantánamo had to close. But in 2009, political headwinds began to rise. A White House plan to release in Virginia two Chinese detainees, judged not to be ''enemy combatants'' after all, prompted an uproar, and that summer Congress banned any such releases on domestic soil. That set the stage for another pivotal event: In January 2010, Scott Brown, a Republican, won a surprise victory in a special election to fill a vacant Senate seat in liberal Massachusetts. Polling data showed that no issue had boosted him more than his attack on Democrats for sending terrorists to domestic civilian courts rather than to Guantánamo. Mr. Brown had pounded on that theme after a Nigerian man was charged with trying to blow up a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas with a bomb in his underwear. ''National security was more important to us than health care,'' Eric Fehrnstrom, a strategist for the Brown campaign, said in a recent interview. Members of Congress from both parties took heed. By the end of January, Democrats from New York turned against the Obama administration's plan to send five Guantánamo detainees accused in the Sept. 11 attacks to Manhattan for a civilian trial; the White House retreated. Soon after, the Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, told fellow party members that the message that terrorists should always be handled as enemy combatants, not criminal defendants, was powerful political ammunition. ''I hope the administration is beginning to get the message here that where they are is not only wrong on the merits but wrong politically,'' Mr. McConnell said during a question period after a blistering speech attacking Mr. Obama's terrorism policies on Feb. 3, 2010. ''I tell my members, 'Hey, you can campaign on these issues anywhere in America -- as Scott Brown demonstrated in the most liberal state in America.' '' From that point on, it became an ideological article of faith for nearly all Republicans that Guantánamo should stay open, and that newly captured terrorism suspects should be sent there and handled exclusively by the military. That was a turnabout for their party -- the Bush administration had regularly and successfully charged terrorism suspects in federal court. Every event in counterterrorism began to be reinterpreted in light of this new Republican stance. Mr. Obama's critics declared repeatedly that the would-be Christmas bomber had stopped talking because he was read the Miranda warning and given a defense lawyer, showing that F.B.I.-style interrogations did not work for terrorists. In fact, he had stopped talking before he was read the warning, and the F.B.I.'s methods, including enlisting the help of his family, were successful: In just a few weeks, the committed zealot started cooperating and provided a wealth of intelligence. When a former Guantánamo detainee, Ahmed Ghailani, was tried in federal court in the fall of 2010 and acquitted on almost all charges brought against him related to the 1998 East Africa embassy bombings -- mostly individual murder counts for each person who died -- Republicans portrayed the outcome as a victory for the defendant that showed civilian courts were too weak for terrorists. But he was still convicted of his role in that attack and sentenced to life in prison. Federal civilian prosecutors have been ruthlessly effective, winning severe sentences in one terrorism case after another, including a death sentence for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the Boston Marathon bomber. Republicans have continued to portray military commissions as the far stronger option, but the reverse appears to be true. The Sept. 11 case, the most important terrorism case in American history, has been mired in years of pretrial hearings as it has stumbled through one problem after another, including defense challenges to many of the rules in the untested, built-from-scratch military judicial system. No trial is yet in sight, and years of appeals will lurk beyond any distant, hypothetical conviction. The handful of convictions the system has produced, mostly from plea deals, have yielded relatively brief sentences. An illustrative case is that of Ibrahim al-Qosi, a Sudanese man who was once Osama bin Laden's cook and driver. Captured in 2001, he pleaded guilty in 2010 to ''providing material support for terrorism,'' was required to serve two more years, and was repatriated in 2012. Mr. Qosi recently appeared in a propaganda video from Al Qaeda's Yemen branch, and Republicans have pointed to his case as an example of the folly of the administration's policy of transferring lower-level detainees. The fact was that Mr. Qosi was released because of the military commissions system. Polarization Deepens At the end of 2010, Congress banned transferring detainees to the United States for any purpose, including trials, and imposed steep restrictions on sending any elsewhere. Since then, the polarization over Guantánamo, often feeding on inaccuracies, has grown only deeper. Whenever the Obama administration does transfer a detainee, Republican critics portray that step as reckless, arguing that ''recidivism'' data shows that one of every three who are released will go on to engage in terrorist or insurgent activity. In fact, the one-in-three figure comes from confirmed and suspected problems among the 532 men who were transferred in the Bush era -- an effort that included bulk repatriations of Saudis and Afghans. The Obama administration has used a far more calibrated and individualized review process in deciding whom to release and where to send them. Of 146 men transferred since 2009, only six are ''confirmed'' and six more are ''suspected'' to have caused problems -- about one in 12, according to the most recent public data. Republicans have lately adopted a new talking point: that the less risky detainees have been long since transferred, so only the most dangerous prisoners remain. That is inaccurate, too. There are some high-level terrorists at the prison, including the 9/11 defendants. But there are also many low-level detainees who remain only because they are from Yemen, which is in turmoil. The government only recently started resettling Yemenis elsewhere; of the 36 left on the transfer list today, 29 are Yemenis. The fact that those prisoners are still at Guantánamo ''does not mean that they, as a group, are more dangerous than other detainees,'' Lee Wolosky, the State Department envoy who negotiates detainee transfers, said at a recent panel discussion. ''It means they are more Yemeni than other detainees.'' Back in late 2001, when the Bush administration opened the prison, it was an ad hoc solution to an immediate problem: the need to hold hundreds of prisoners captured in Afghanistan away from the war zone. Few imagined it would still be operating -- at a cost of nearly half a billion dollars a year -- almost 15 years later. The isolated American naval base in Cuba seemed to offer a key advantage: The Bush administration believed the prisoners were beyond the reach of any court and not protected by the Geneva Conventions. But a series of Supreme Court rulings demolished those claims, establishing court jurisdiction and declaring that the Geneva Conventions protected them. That helped persuade President Bush to move toward closing it; in his 2010 memoir, he wrote that the ''detention facility had become a propaganda tool for our enemies and a distraction for our allies.'' They are the very same arguments Mr. Obama still makes today. The United States appears certain to be holding some detainees without trial when Mr. Obama leaves office, though it seems possible that the number will reach zero under a successor. But the Republican presidential candidates have a different vision, which some discussed when Mr. Obama announced his closing plan Feb. 23. ''We're going to load it up with some bad dudes,'' Donald J. Trump told a cheering crowd in Nevada. For good measure, he also promised to cut the prison operation's cost -- some $40 million a month -- to ''peanuts.'' He did not explain how.

Egypt's interior minister, Maj. Gen. Magdi Abdel-Ghaffar, described at a news conference a plot to kill the prosecutor, Hisham Barakat, that he linked to exiled Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Turkey and a Hamas training camp in the Gaza Strip. Hamas denied the charges on Sunday. In June, at the time of the bombing, the Muslim Brotherhood denied any involvement in the killing of the prosecutor. ''These statements are untrue and do not bode well for ongoing efforts to develop ties between Hamas and Cairo,'' Samy Abu Zahri, a Hamas spokesman, said in a statement. Mr. Barakat, who spearheaded the prosecution and mass trials of thousands of Islamists, was killed when a car bomb containing more than 175 pounds of explosives was detonated as his vehicle drove through a Cairo suburb on June 29. Mr. Barakat was the most senior official to be killed in Egypt in 25 years. The assassination prompted President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to introduce an antiterrorism law that expanded the powers of Egypt's security forces and restricted civil liberties. The killing was part of a wave of attacks against government officials and the security forces that followed the military's ouster of the Islamist president, Mohamed Morsi, in 2013. After the removal of Mr. Morsi, the government outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood, killed hundreds of its supporters at a demonstration in Cairo and jailed thousands more. Many Muslim Brotherhood leaders fled into exile in Turkey. On Sunday, General Abdel-Ghaffar, the interior minister, said the authorities had arrested 48 Muslim Brotherhood supporters across Egypt in connection with various plots to attack government targets, including 14 suspected of being involved in the assassination of Mr. Barakat. General Abdel-Ghaffar accused Yahia Moussa, a Health Ministry spokesman under Mr. Morsi, of coordinating the attack from Turkey, and said the suspects had received military and explosives training at a Hamas-run camp in the Gaza Strip. The men were sent back into Egypt with the help of Bedouin smugglers in the Sinai Peninsula and communicated with their handlers using the Internet, General Abdel-Ghaffar said.

Their dignity, their freedom, their families, their hope. Perhaps most disturbingly, they have lost their own names, or rather tried to forget them. Caught up in the brutal violence of Liberian civil war, held captive as ''wives,'' really sexual slaves, of a rebel commanding officer, they prefer to refer to one another anonymously -- as Number One or Number Three -- as if their lives before the horror descended upon them never happened. It's more painful to remember than to forget. For all its harrowing power, ''Eclipsed,'' headlined by the Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o, one of the most radiant young actors to be seen on Broadway in recent seasons, shines with a compassion that makes us see beyond the suffering to the indomitable humanity of its characters. And although the events it depicts happened more than a decade ago, the play resonates powerfully today, as more than one African country continues to be plagued by atrocious violence, with women often the most brutalized victims. (Let us not forget the hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped by the radical Islamist group Boko Haram in Nigeria who remain unaccounted for to this day.) Under the bright lights of Broadway, where escapist fare or genteel revivals most often thrive, Ms. Gurira's play, directed with clarity and force by Liesl Tommy, reminds us of something profoundly important, and perhaps too easily forgotten amid our own country's continuing racial troubles: African lives matter. The play takes place in and around the squalid hut where the women are held captive in a rebel compound. It's a bullet-riddled shanty with virtually no furnishings. Presiding over this grim ménage is the first woman kidnapped by the ''C.O.,'' as the women refer to their captor. She is thus designated Wife No. 1, and is played with maternal warmth and steely fortitude by Saycon Sengbloh. She was taken when she was a teenager, and has been held for more than 10 years, although she cannot be sure of her exact age. As the play opens, she and the heavily pregnant Wife No. 3, played with remnants of rebellious adolescence by Pascale Armand, are desperately attempting to shelter a young woman referred to only as the Girl, played by Ms. Nyong'o. (She must be the first actor ever to win entrance applause after emerging from under a grimy rubber tub, where her character hides to sleep.) Fleeing fighting in her village, she stumbled into the compound. The women know that if she's discovered, she will be victimized as they are. But there's nowhere much to hide, and when the Girl leaves the hut to go to the bathroom in the woods, she is found out, and immediately brought to the C.O. and raped, initiated into a life of sexual servitude. The scenes in which the (unseen) commanding officer approaches the women's shelter, and in terror they jump to line up so he can choose among them, are almost as disturbing as the moments when they return, hollow-eyed but matter-of-fact, and wash themselves mechanically. Ms. Gurira's ''Familiar,'' an immensely enjoyable comedy-drama about a Zimbabwean-American family, opened Off Broadway just last week. It's a much lighter play -- almost any play onstage right now is -- but while the events in ''Eclipsed'' are painful to contemplate, even this corrosive drama has moments of welcome levity. Wife No. 3's fretting over her wigs, her recalcitrant hair (patiently tended to by Wife No. 1) and her clothing is a funny and touching indication that, abused as she has been, she still retains a smattering of self-esteem. And to while away the time, the Girl reads passages from a battered biography of Bill Clinton that has found its way into the compound. The women eagerly follow his fortunes as if attending to local gossip, comically referring to Monica Lewinsky as Wife No. 2. When the second wife of the commanding officer returns to the hut, clad in snazzy jeans and slinging a rifle over her shoulder, the central drama in ''Eclipsed'' emerges. Played with a cool intensity by Zainab Jah, Wife No. 2 has escaped sexual servitude the only way possible, by taking up arms and fighting alongside the rebels. Although Wife No. 3 delights in the pile of clothing brought by the second wife, Wife No. 1 looks with contempt upon this conciliatory offering; despite her years of being brutalized, she has held on to her morality, and disapproves of the self-serving trade-off that Wife No. 2 has made. Wife No. 1 takes some solace in the occasional visits from Rita (the fine Akosua Busia), an emissary from a world away, it almost seems, who is trying to help broker a peace agreement. But peace does not arrive before Wife No. 2 has persuaded the Girl to take up arms alongside her, despite entreaties by Wife No. 1 to resist. Ms. Nyong'o, simply superb, illuminates her character's conflicted feelings with pinpoint clarity. Fearful though she is when we first meet her, the Girl still retains the glowing innocence of youth; it's only when she has been inaugurated into a life of sexual slavery that the light in her eyes begins to falter. But the Girl proves dangerously susceptible to the seduction of the comparative freedom enjoyed by Wife No. 2, who tells her that by joining in the killing she can at least have some control over her own life. (Ms. Nyong'o is hardly recognizable as the smiling beauty disconcertingly fondling a Lancôme bottle in an advertisement on the back of the Playbill -- talk about cognitive dissonance!) ''Eclipsed'' reaches a gut-churning climax in a monologue delivered with shellshocked confusion by Ms. Nyong'o, in which the Girl recounts being forced to participate in unimaginable atrocities. Shame, revulsion and something like disbelief mingle in her hushed recital of the brutality she was forced not just to witness but to share in. We have the sorrowful sense that she has been shaken into a terrible awareness: It is not just the suffering she endured that will haunt her forever, but the suffering she inflicted.

The lyrics, letters, photographs and other ephemera among the more than 6,000 items in the archive represent decades of American history. Arguably just as important as Mr. Dylan's items are the memories carried by generations of fans. So we asked readers to share something from their own personal Dylan archives: the vinyl copy of ''Blonde on Blonde'' that survived moves, marriages and children; the ticket stub that conjures mental images of an inspiring performance; the bootlegged recording from the show. Along with interesting images submitted by readers were some great stories. A teacher who used Mr. Dylan's writing in her poetry classes received a rare audience with him after a concert, when he signed a book of his poems. A visit with Mr. Dylan's mother. A bottle of bourbon from a backstage dressing room. Here's a sampling of the responses, which were edited for length and clarity. ''I made a snapshot of Bob Dylan in concert [at the Coliseum] in Washington, D.C., in 1965. From my seat I could visualize a great shot: There was the blue spot backlighting Dylan's hair. I bluffed the security guards to allow me backstage for a few seconds, telling them I was shooting for Life magazine. This wasn't exactly true, but inasmuch as I was a freelancer working for them quite a bit, I had enough confidence to say so. I made a few frames using a Nikon F and a 300mm lens, with High Speed Ektachrome. Days later, I took the resulting images to John Berg at Columbia Records. I placed the meager stack of slides on his desk. John picked up the first one and said, 'That's the next cover.' It all happened in less time than it takes to tell this story. It was used as the album cover for 'Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits.' A few months later, John telegraphed to say we had won a Grammy Award for 1967's best album cover. I am so proud that our iconic image graces the cover of this seminal album.'' -- Rowland Scherman, Orleans, Mass. ''My wife has a postcard. On one side is printed 'I'm drunk, what's your excuse?' On the other are the autographs of Dylan and Joan Baez. She got this gem at a concert in Connecticut around 1964, when Bob came up to her and some friends as they were walking to the venue and asked for a bite of her hamburger.'' -- Trent Jones, New York City ''As a teenager, I acquired the habit of reading the NYT on Sunday ... religiously! On this particular Sunday -- October 18, 1964 -- I tore out an advertisement (from Columbia Records) for the newest Dylan album, 'Another Side of Bob Dylan.' I still have the full-page picture of Dylan (with the thumb-sized print of the album cover) and the quote (never directly attributed to Dylan through his writings): ''Yes it is I who is knocking at your door, if it is you inside who hears the noise.'' A little faded and somewhat tattered, this piece (preserved only in a clear plastic box frame) has followed me from the NY Island to California and back again.'' -- Peggy DeStefano, Enfield, N.H. ''On my office wall I have framed two images of Dylan that I took from the balcony of the Hartford Atheneum on Oct. 30, 1965. At the time I was a student in a minute boarding school in Connecticut, and my fellow seniors and I had persuaded the administration to let us arrange for a bus, order tickets, and make a pilgrimage across the state to hear Dylan. Shortly after I took the photos, they ran in the four-page student newspaper, of which I was an editor, and that was the end of them. But about 10 years ago, an envelope arrived in the mail from a high school classmate, containing two tiny prints of photos he had taken of the photos that ran in the newspaper. I scanned them, worked them in Photoshop and now they live on my office wall. And on the mat, under the images, I have the quote, 'He not busy being born is busy dying.' Words to live by at 70, or any other age for that matter.'' -- B. D. Cohen, Cambridge, Mass. ''All I have is his mother's autograph written on stationery from the store where she worked in Hibbing, Minn., in 1967. When I was 18, on a dare, I hitchhiked to Hibbing from Marquette, Mich. I got to Hibbing, went to a phone booth, and looked up Abe Zimmerman to get the address. Then I walked over to the Zimmerman home, knocked on the door and was crushed to realize nobody was home. Looking in the window of the door, I could see Bob and his brother David's high school graduation photos on a piano. I went next door and asked if that was the home of the parents of 'Bob Dylan, the folk singer.' A patient woman said yes, and that they were at work. She then said she'd drive me downtown to where Mrs. Zimmerman worked. I walked into the store and a charming woman, obviously Dylan's mom, asked if she could help me. I explained who I was and why I was there. She and I spoke for about 45 minutes. I remember she always talked about Bob and David, his brother, equally. Also, like anybody's mother, she defended him. 'Bobby has that song, ''All I Want To Do Is Be Friends'' or something like that. And it's true! He just wants to be friends with people!' At one point she said, 'Does your mother know you're here?' I said no, and she frowned. 'You should call your mother once you and I are done talking. Bobby always called me wherever he was.' I said I would. We talked about how Bob was doing, the fact that he was still having headaches from his motorcycle accident a year before. I asked for his address and she smiled, 'I'm sorry, but Bobby doesn't have an address.' We both laughed. At one point she said she should give me her autograph. 'Nobody is going to believe you did this.' So I now have that autograph, and a memory of a charming woman who had the patience to talk to a kid who stuck his thumb out on a road one Saturday morning.'' -- Michael Kennedy, Portland, Ore. ''At the age of 16 I spent three weeks in Chicago on a summer study program, and at an 'underground' record store I purchased a copy of the first Dylan bootleg, known at the 'Great White Wonder.' While there were no liner notes or descriptions, I was able to figure out that a number of cuts were with the Band, in what would later be known as 'The Basement Tapes.' The idea that I had a noncommercial, secret stash of wisdom was quite powerful. I still have that album to this day.'' -- Flip Brown, Burlington, Vt. ''In 1985, my wife and I were flying back to New York from a trip to Minneapolis. Mr. Dylan and his son [were] seated in the row in front of us and a half-curtain divided our seats in economy and his in the last row of first-class. All during the flight Mr. Dylan wrote in a small notebook. It felt to us that everyone on the plane was curious to read what was on his mind. At one point, he got up and went to the restroom in the back of the plane. He took the notebook with him.'' -- Jim Anderson, Brooklyn, N.Y. ''My first recording of Bob Dylan was a 45 r.p.m. record of 'Like a Rolling Stone,' with a flip side of 'The Gates of Eden.' I was a kid in growing up on a farm in Rupert, Idaho, and I listened to that music over and over until I knew every word and every turn of melody. I was already taking piano and organ lessons at the time, and Dylan's music most certainly contributed to my own choice of living a life of music.'' -- Lynette Westendorf, Winthrop, Wash. ''Among some good stuff, I have the media kit from Bob Dylan's Kennedy Center honors. I was working for a news agency at the time. After a ceremony at the White House before the show, I happened to notice him leaving through the North Portico. I asked him if he had ever been to the White House before. In the somewhat goofy, borscht belt humor mode he's been known for over the last few decades, he replied, pointing: 'There it is, right there.''' -- Pedro, Washington, D.C. ''A lovely little anthology of Bulgarian translations of Dylan songs, published in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, 1984. The title is 'ÐYÐ¾ÐµÑ[#x201a]Ð¸ Ñ ÐºÐ¸Ñ[#x201a]Ð°Ñ[#x20ac]Ð°: Ð'Ð¾Ð± Ð""Ð¸Ð»Ñ[#x160]Ð½' ('Poets with Guitars: Bob Dylan'), and the songs (and poems) are translated from Dylan's 1974 'Writings and Drawings.' There's an original foreword ('I Will Sing Until the Final Moment') and afterword ('Chimes of Freedom') by the translators Leda Mileva and Nikolai Popov. The purple hardback is about 9 inches square, with a fourfold poster and a 45 r.p.m. disc with 'Don't Think Twice, It's All Right' and 'Blowin' in the Wind' tucked in a pocket inside the back cover.'' -- Glen Worthey, Los Altos, Calif. ''I have a page from his high school teacher apologizing for talking in class and signed by Bobby Zimmerman, as well as his report cards from his senior year.'' -- Bob, Brooklyn, N.Y. ''I attended the 1978 Dylan concert in Atlanta, Ga. I have the ticket stub and the T-shirt from that show. The shirt was originally black, faded from wear. Also it was 'customized' with the sleeves cut out by me.'' -- Lee A. Johnson, Valdosta, Ga. ''I have an empty bottle of Maker's Mark whiskey from a show at the Opera House in Boston, during the 'Oh Mercy' tour. Dylan was touring with some of his current band and G. E. Smith. I was working as a stagehand, and thought I would meet him. When the crew arrived, I suggested I would like to just say hello and have him sign a copy of 'Tarantula.' His [tour] manager said, 'I've been touring with Bob Dylan for 5 years, I've never had a conversation with him.' Oh well. I did get the Maker's Mark bottle after the show.'' -- Mark, Central Massachusetts  URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/arts/music/your-back-pages-readers-share-dylan -memories.html"

(PHOTOGRAPHS BY SARA KRULWICH/THE NEW YORK TIMES)",7-Mar-16,,,,OPERA (90%); MUSIC GROUPS & ARTISTS (78%); MARRIAGE (69%); FAMILY LAW (64%),"Two years ago at the Metropolitan Opera, the Mexican tenor Javier Camarena absolutely nailed a bravura aria in Rossini's ''La Cenerentola,'' setting off an ovation that would not stop until he repeated its flashy final section -- a rare occurrence of an aria encore at the Met. On Friday night it nearly happened again. Portraying Ernesto in Donizetti's ''Don Pasquale,'' Mr. Camarena excitingly sang the elaborate bel canto aria ''E se fia che ad altro oggetto,'' capped by a fearless high D flat. As Mr. Camarena's Ernesto rushed offstage, having vowed to seek solace from heartbreak in faraway lands, the audience broke into such a frenzied ovation that I thought he just might return for an encore performance. That's what the audience clearly wanted. But he stayed backstage as the staging dictated, and the performance continued. This was his first Met appearance since that brief run in ''Cenerentola.'' He sang with evenness throughout his range, with tender pianissimos and, when called for, with engaging feistiness. It's good to have him back. Other news was made as well with this revival of Otto Schenk's charmingly traditional 2006 production. The Italian baritone Ambrogio Maestri sang his first Don Pasquale, bringing his powerhouse voice and larger-than-life presence to that touchstone role, a crotchety old bachelor in mid-19th-century Rome who, fed up with Ernesto, his footloose nephew and heir, foolishly decides to disinherit the young man and to take a wife. The bright-voiced, vivacious Italian soprano Eleonora Buratto had a rousingly received Met debut as Norina, the young widow who loves Ernesto. The conductor, Maurizio Benini, a bel canto specialist, drew animated and stylish, if sometimes overpowering, playing from the Met orchestra. Even with his tall, hefty physique, Mr. Maestri, a compelling actor, is surprisingly light on his feet. This rumpled Pasquale, his gray hair a mess, has let himself and his villa fall into a shambles. At the start, he nervously awaits his reliable physician, Dr. Malatesta (the muscular-voiced baritone Levente Molnar), to seek advice about getting married. Malatesta, who is friends with Ernesto, suggests the perfect bride: his sister, fresh from the convent. It's all a ruse to teach Pasquale a lesson. Malatesta convinces Norina to play his sister and to hoodwink the gullible Pasquale into a phony marriage contract. Once the papers are signed, the innocent bride becomes a bullying, shrewish spendthrift, a transition that is nicely handled by Ms. Buratto. Mr. Maestri plumbed the serious core of this comic masterpiece by playing the role straight. Pasquale emerged as haplessly foolish yet endearingly vulnerable. In the midst of a fiery argument with her ''husband,'' Norina slaps Pasquale. Mr. Maestri looked stunned and humiliated. ''È finita, Don Pasquale,'' he sings, meaning, ''It's all over for Don Pasquale.'' I will not soon forget the aching way he sang these mournful lines. And who knows? As the run continues, maybe audiences will demand an encore of Mr. Camarena's big aria. ''Don Pasquale'' runs through March 18 at the Metropolitan Opera; 212-362-6000, metopera­.org.

The previously undisclosed meetings, which were held in Geneva with Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations and future foreign minister, continued even after American troops seized Baghdad in April 2003. ''We wanted a commitment that Iran would not fire on U.S. aircraft if they accidentally flew over Iranian territory,'' Zalmay Khalilzad, a former ambassador to Iraq, Afghanistan and the United Nations, wrote in the ''The Envoy,'' being published this month by St. Martin's Press. ''Zarif agreed,'' he added. ''We also hoped Iran would encourage Iraqi Shiites to participate constructively in establishing a new government in Iraq.'' Some prominent Iraqi Shiite leaders who had opposed Hussein had long been supported by Iran, which is the major Shiite power in the region. But the Americans and Iranians had major differences over how to form a new Iraqi government and deal with Tehran's support for terrorism. In May 2003, the Bush administration halted the dialogue after it accused Iran of harboring leaders of Al Qaeda who were blamed for a terrorist attack that killed eight Americans in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. More than a decade later, Mr. Khalilzad considers the failure to keep open a continuous channel to Iran one of the great what-ifs of the Iraq war. ''I am convinced that if we had combined diplomatic engagement with forcible actions, we could have shaped Iran's conduct,'' he wrote. The book is being published as heated debate continues over the Obama administration's policy toward Tehran, including the terms of the nuclear accord the United States and five other world powers negotiated with Iran. The book by Mr. Khalilzad, a naturalized American who was born in Afghanistan and earned a doctorate at the University of Chicago, offers new insight into the debate over policy toward Iran within the Bush administration. Whether there was real potential for a constructive dialogue with Iran about Iraq during the Bush years has been much debated. Ryan C. Crocker, a veteran diplomat, said that while officials from the two nations had productive consultations over Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the prospects for a similar discussion on postwar Iraq were greatly diminished after President George W. Bush described Iran as a member of the ''axis of evil'' in his January 2002 State of the Union address. ''The chance for a serious dialogue that might actually have led somewhere pretty much ended with 'axis of evil,' '' said Mr. Crocker, who served as an American envoy to Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries in the region. But Mr. Khalilzad was eager to see if the United States could elicit cooperation from Iran before the March 2003 invasion of Iraq, and the White House authorized him to meet with Mr. Zarif. Accompanied by Mr. Crocker, Mr. Khalilzad informed Mr. Zarif that the Bush administration wanted to establish a democratic government in Baghdad that would be at peace with its neighbors -- a formulation that was intended to signal that the United States did not plan to expand its military operations into Iranian territory. Mr. Zarif, however, had his own ideas on how postwar Iraq should be governed. He favored a quick handover to Iraqi exiles, argued that Iraqi security institutions should be rebuilt from the ground up, called for the extensive purging of former members of Hussein's Baath Party and opposed an American occupation, Mr. Khalilzad wrote. That approach, which appeared designed to magnify Iran's influence inside Iraq, differed radically from Mr. Khalilzad's strategy to form an interim Iraqi government that included Iraqis who had remained in the country during Hussein's rule, and not just leaders in exile. Nor did Mr. Khalilzad favor sweeping purges of Baath Party members. When the issue of terrorism was on the table in a May 2003 meeting, Mr. Zarif asked the United States to hand over leaders of the Mujahedeen Khalq, an Iranian opposition group known as the MEK, whom Hussein had given refuge in Iraq. Mr. Khalilzad, in turn, complained that Iran was harboring Qaeda officials, including Osama bin Laden's son. That prompted the Iranians to ''air the possibility of a direct exchange -- MEK leaders for Al Qaeda leaders,'' Mr. Khalilzad wrote. The Bush administration rejected the notion and then shut down the diplomatic channel that month after it linked the terrorist attack in Riyadh to Qaeda leaders in Iran. Mr. Zarif did not respond to emails seeking comment. After being named ambassador to Iraq in 2005, Mr. Khalilzad continued to argue privately for opening a channel to Iran. Iraqi officials who traveled to Tehran told the American envoy that Iran was open to talking, and there was an occasion in 2006 during which American and Iranian policies appeared to overlap, Mr. Khalilzad asserts: Both countries concluded that the ineffectual Ibrahim al-Jaafari needed to be replaced as prime minister. Mr. Khalilzad wrote that Qassim Suleimani, the head of Iran's paramilitary Quds force, secretly traveled to Baghdad to deliver the message that Mr. Jaafari had to go. Mr. Khalilzad wrote that during a meeting of the National Security Council, he persuaded Mr. Bush that he should be authorized to open a dialogue with the Iranians. Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, the leader of a Shiite party with close ties to Tehran, traveled to Iran and urged Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, to resume the talks. The Iranian leader agreed, and the Iranians assembled a team drawn from their Foreign Ministry and security agencies for the Baghdad-based talks, which an Iranian official publicly said Iran would attend. Despite the high-profile nature of the Iranian delegation, Mr. Khalilzad said, he planned to focus on Iraq and ignore Iranian efforts to draw him into a discussion of a broader foreign policy agenda. ''For reasons that remain unclear to me, Washington did an about-face and canceled the meeting at the last minute,'' Mr. Khalilzad wrote. ''Khamenei, Hakim informed me, concluded from the incident that the Americans could not be trusted.'' Eventually, Mr. Khalilzad notes, the administration authorized ''carefully circumscribed talks on Iraq,'' which he and later Mr. Crocker pursued in Baghdad, but the discussions were not productive. Philip D. Zelikow, who served as the State Department counselor at the time, said he was not aware of the National Security Council meeting that Mr. Khalilzad cited, but argued that the conditions in 2006 were not propitious for successful talks. By 2005, State Department officials were becoming increasingly concerned that Iran was supplying Shiite militias with powerful improvised explosives and other weapons to attack American troops. Mr. Zelikow argued that it would have made little sense to open talks with Iran until the United States was prepared to mount a serious crackdown on the Shiite militias and the Iranian network that was supporting them. That did not happen until 2007, when Mr. Bush authorized an increase of American troops and Gen. David H. Petraeus and Mr. Crocker were sent to Baghdad, he added. ''Until then, why bother talking to the Iranians about this issue if there was no muscle behind it?'' Mr. Zelikow said. But Mr. Khalilzad insists in his book that he favored tougher action against Iran in parallel with diplomacy, which led to the detention of a senior Iranian Quds force officer in Baghdad in December 2006, three months before Mr. Khalilzad wound up his tour there as ambassador. The Bush administration, he wrote, ''never authorized the kind of continuous engagement that might have shaped Iran's conduct.''

Even Mrs. Clinton joined in the repudiation of her husband's 1994 crime bill and 1996 welfare law, which both disproportionately harmed African-Americans. Both she and Mr. Sanders are aggressively courting black voters in Michigan, Ohio and other racially diverse states that hold primaries over the next nine days, but Mr. Sanders has an urgent need to cut into Mrs. Clinton's support among African-Americans. Mr. Sanders, who has fallen far behind Mrs. Clinton in their all-important race to accumulate delegates to clinch the party's nomination, has rarely been so aggressive. He portrayed Mrs. Clinton as an unapologetic champion of free trade for much of her career, in hopes of hurting her with Rust Belt Democrats. He tied her aggressively to the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mr. Clinton's signature trade policy, and to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, President Obama's 12-nation trade pact, which she supported as secretary of state but then denounced as a presidential candidate. Mr. Sanders also attacked Mrs. Clinton's support of the federal Export-Import Bank, the credit agency that antigovernment populists on both sides have called an instrument of ''corporate welfare,'' and he feigned amazement when she expressed criticism of some trade deals. ''Secretary Clinton has discovered religion on this issue, but it's a little bit too late,'' Mr. Sanders said. ''I was on a picket line in the early 1990s against Nafta, because you didn't need a Ph.D. in economics to understand that American workers should not be forced to compete against people in Mexico making 25 cents an hour.'' For the most part, Mrs. Clinton deftly parried her rival's arguments, deriding many of them and agreeing with a few, and at times interrupting Mr. Sanders in hopes of provoking a testy explosion. Mr. Sanders grew visibly angry at times, though he was not as volatile as the Republican candidates have been in recent debates. When he attacked Mrs. Clinton over what he called ''the Wall Street bailout where some of your friends destroyed the economy,'' she tried to cut him off. ''Excuse me, I'm talking,'' he said. After a brief dramatic pause, Mrs. Clinton said sharply, ''If you're going to talk, tell the whole story.'' ''Let me tell my story and you tell yours,'' Mr. Sanders shot back. Mrs. Clinton, who is focused on protecting her delegate lead, sought to stay positive, pointing to more salutary achievements from her husband's two terms. ''If we're going to talk about the 1990s, let's talk about 23 million new jobs -- incomes went up for everybody, median African-American income went up 33 percent at the end of the '90s, and we lifted more people out of poverty than at any other time in recent history,'' she said. The focus on the economic fortunes of African-Americans had a powerful setting in Sunday's debate: Flint, a city in the midst of a public health emergency over lead-tainted water, and a symbol of a middle class that rose to prosperity with the auto industry, but where 42 percent of the majority African-American population now lives below the poverty line.Mrs. Clinton came armed with a resonant retort to Mr. Sanders over his Wall Street attacks, reminding the Michigan audience that Mr. Sanders voted against the auto industry bailout and again calling him a ''single issue'' candidate too narrowly focused on Wall Street. ''If everybody had voted the way he did, I believe the auto industry would have collapsed, taking four million jobs with it,'' she said. Mr. Sanders allowed that perhaps he was a single-issue candidate. ''My one issue is trying to rebuild a disappearing middle class,'' he said. The candidates also grew testy on gun control. When the father of a young girl injured in a recent shooting in nearby Kalamazoo asked what the candidates would do about gun control, Mrs. Clinton criticized Mr. Sanders. ''Giving immunity to gun makers and sellers was a terrible mistake because it removed any accountability from the makers and the sellers,'' she said, referring to Mr. Sanders's position. ''Maybe I'm wrong, but what you're really talking about is people saying, let's end gun manufacturing in America,'' Mr. Sanders said of the immunity issue. ''That's the implication of that and I don't agree with that.'' When Mrs. Clinton pounced again, Mr. Sanders was terse: ''Can I finish please? All right?'' More than she has in past debates, Mrs. Clinton sought to reach out to Mr. Sanders's supporters in hopes of uniting the factions of the Democratic Party in anticipation of a general election campaign. Instead of looking away as Mr. Sanders spoke, as she often did in past debates, Mrs. Clinton watched him and nodded frequently as he talked about Flint. She colorfully agreed with him in the debate's opening moments when, after Mr. Sanders decried the water crisis, she said, ''Amen to that.'' For the first time she echoed his call for the resignation of Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan (or, alternatively, she said he should be recalled). ''I know the state of Michigan has a rainy-day fund for emergencies,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''It is raining lead in Flint.'' But at Sunday's debate, Mr. Sanders struck some more aggressive notes on Flint than he had in the past, embracing Mrs. Clinton's call to have the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention evaluate the health of every adult and child in the city. ''Federal government comes in, federal government acts,'' Mr. Sanders said. Mrs. Clinton then sounded some tougher notes, saying that she would ''have a full investigation to determine who knew what when'' in the Environmental Protection Agency, and that ''people should be fired.'' Mr. Sanders followed with an even sharper statement, saying, ''President Sanders would fire anybody who knew about what was happening and did not act accordingly.'' The Flint debate was the first since the South Carolina primary, when Mrs. Clinton began to open up a commanding lead over Mr. Sanders in the race for the 2,383 delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination. On Sunday night, she sought to protect her edge with African-Americans, who have helped her more than any other constituency. She pushed back against a question from a CNN debate moderator, Don Lemon, about why black voters should trust her promises to reform the criminal justice system since she supported the 1994 crime bill, which sent so many black men to prison. Mrs. Clinton noted that Mr. Sanders had voted for the bill, but she then criticized it, saying, ''Too many families were broken up, too many communities were adversely affected.'' But when Mr. Lemon pressed Mrs. Clinton about why African-Americans should stand by her, she struggled a bit: ''Senator Sanders voted for it as well,'' she said. ''Are you going to ask him that question?'' Mr. Sanders said there were parts of the legislation, like the Violence Against Women Act and the assault weapons ban, which he supported. ''There are bills in Congress that have bad stuff. There are bills in Congress that have good stuff -- good stuff and bad stuff in the same bill,'' he said, as Mrs. Clinton nodded. When each candidate was asked about racial blind spots, Mrs. Clinton said, ''Being a white person in the United States of America, I know that I've never had the experience that so many of the people in this audience have had.'' She urged white people to think about what it's like for African-American parents ''to have the talk with your kids'' about potentially getting in trouble with the police because of the color of their skin. Mr. Sanders spoke of friends who were discriminated against decades ago and of the Black Lives Matter movement today. ''When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto, you don't know what it's like to be poor,'' he said. ''You don't know what it's like to be hassled when you walk down the street or get dragged out of a car.'' One of Mrs. Clinton's most uncomfortable moments came when she was asked about her comments in a 1996 speech about crime in which she referred to some young urban gang members as ''super predators.'' Mrs. Clinton said that it had been ''a poor choice of words'' and that she had not used the term since then. Mr. Sanders, who seldom speaks of his Jewish faith, answered a question about it by saying he was ''very proud of being Jewish'' and called it ''an essential part of who I am as a human being.'' Recalling that his father's family was ''wiped out by Hitler in the Holocaust,'' he added, ''I know what crazy and radical and extremist politics mean. I learned that lesson as a tiny, tiny child.'' Mrs. Clinton said she prays each day. ''I need that strength and I need that support,'' she said. ''I pray for the will of God to be known so that we can know it and, to the best of our limited ability, try to follow it and fulfill it.''

89,The New York Times,7-Mar-16,A Photojournalist Resists His More Devilish Side,Late Edition - Final,,,By MIKE HALE,ENGLISH,Review,,UNITED STATES (93%),Section C; Column 0; The Arts/Cultural Desk; Pg. 3,,Newspaper,,,609 words,"PHOTO: Damien: Bradley James in the title role in this series, Mondays on A&E.

Throughout the early episodes, whenever he has flashbacks to his childhood, he sees clips from ''The Omen.'' Talk about hell on earth! The most interesting thing about ''Damien,'' which was developed by the former ''Walking Dead'' showrunner Glen Mazzara and begins on Monday night, is how closely it ties itself to that 1976 film about the birth of the Antichrist. (Mercifully, it ignores the intervening sequels.) The devil dogs are back. Clues to the plot once again are hidden in the backgrounds of photographs. One character maintains a basement museum of Damien memorabilia, including the tricycle he used to assault his mother. The adult Damien (Bradley James of ''Merlin''), a 30-year-old photojournalist, repeats the investigation his adoptive father conducted in the film, discovering that the hospital where he was born long ago burned down. All of these details are entertaining for the viewer who's seen the ridiculous but amusingly creepy original. They can't disguise the fact, however, that ''Damien'' the TV series is a fairly generic supernatural conspiracy thriller with elements of the police procedural, a well-populated genre. (Recent examples: ''Dig'' on USA, ''Zero Hour'' on ABC.) Its production values and moody cinematography are better than average, but it's unlikely to send any shivers down your spine. ''The Omen'' tried to raise the stakes of the satanic-possession horror movie by making young Damien the son (secretly adopted) of an American ambassador with designs on political power. In the film, he was last seen smiling at the camera as he held the hand of his new father, the president of the United States. In ''Damien'' we learn that after his early years in the White House, he was sent away to boarding school. More crucially but less credibly, he has forgotten about his satanic childhood. This necessitates the flashbacks, as well as a Devil's helpmate (played by Barbara Hershey), whose main function is to supply exposition about what's happened since ''The Omen.'' The explicit political dimension is replaced by a general mood of social compassion in which evil in the world is linked to the troubles of returning wounded veterans. The new wrinkle in the TV show, necessary for a continuing series, is that Damien is no longer the purely evil brat he was in the movie. He's conspicuously noble, saving people in war zones and in the New York subway. When he hits 30 and triggers a satanic program that causes people around him to start dying in gruesome ways, he's not happy. The story sets up a tension regarding whether his evil nature will win out, but really, what are the chances? Helping Damien retrace his past and decipher strange new events (homicidal dogs, parking-lot sinkholes) are a pair of friends, played by Omid Abtahi and Megalyn Echikunwoke, who have less to do than loyal teammates are usually given in this sort of show. Mr. James, who resembles a less intense Frederick Weller, makes a lightweight Antichrist. Taking advantage of limited screen time in the early going is Scott Wilson of ''The Walking Dead,'' as a former professor of Damien's who has an under-the-radar role in world events. ''The Omen,'' in addition to being a voluptuously silly horror movie, was a statement on the horrors of modern parenting: The Antichrist was a thoroughly human monster child, driving his helpless, guilty parents to seek psychiatric help.

He said he was attacked by a customer last month after catching him stealing from his tip jar.

''I tell him, 'No big deal, I do it for you,''' said Imam Hassanian, 23, who was working in the truck that night -- or morning, technically, almost three hours past midnight on Feb. 26. He turned to the grill. Most of New York City's many food trucks and carts are tucked away in garages at that hour, leaving Mr. Hassanian with little competition. He had settled onto his corner at North Seventh Street and Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, three months ago. There was a subway station and a bar just outside the truck, and many more bars in the surrounding blocks. Mr. Hassanian liked working nights for a reason that had nothing to do with the job. It allowed him to talk to his wife, Nasma. She lives in Cairo, where the time is seven hours ahead. They were married last year, and he hopes to bring her to New York soon. ''I'm just finishing her paperwork,'' he said last week in an interview in his truck. He left Egypt eight years ago, settling in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, with his parents, brother and two sisters, he said. He usually works from 9 p.m. to 4:30 a.m. and then drives the truck to a garage on Third Avenue in Brooklyn to clean it up. He returns it to the corner before 9 in the morning, when the day worker arrives for his 12-hour shift. Mr. Hassanian never had any problems in the trucks where he had worked the past few years. This one bears a large electric sign that boasts, ''We're Very Different,'' but really, it's the same, comfortably familiar menu all over town, from the falafel to the combo plates and gyros. The trouble, first reported in The Brooklyn Paper's police blotter, began at 2:56 a.m., according to the police account. Mr. Hassanian was cooking the man's food. ''I see he starts to steal the money from my tips,'' Mr. Hassanian said, pointing to the plastic jar in the truck's large window. Then, the man threw two $1 bills -- not four -- into the truck. ''I take the $2 in my hand,'' Mr. Hassanian said. '''You give me my money, I give you your money and you go.' He said, 'I didn't take no money.''' Mr. Hassanian raised his cellphone and began recording a video. His wife called just then. He did not answer. The man reached into the truck and shoved a stack of aluminum trays to the floor. Bread, too. White sauce and hot sauce everywhere. The phone's cheery ringtone continued to play. Then, according to the police, the man weaponized the beverage bin beneath the window. ''He took a soda -- boom!'' Mr. Hassanian said. The man hurled it at the truck. Food Paradise was under siege, its sole occupant exposed. Mr. Hassanian ran. ''I go inside Dunkin' Donuts,'' he said. ''He pushed me to stop me.'' There, Mr. Hassanian called 911. The man grabbed two bottles of Snapple from the truck, opened a door of the Dunkin' Donuts and threw them at him. The bottles broke. The man seemed to run off, Mr. Hassanian said, so he stepped out of his sanctuary, only to find the man still there. ''He wants to punch my face,'' Mr. Hassanian said. ''I put up my arm, and he hit me in the arm.'' The police arrived, and the man fled down the stairs of an L train station. Officers followed. The man emerged, Whac-a-Mole-style, from a different entrance across the street. But officers caught him. He fought the arrest, leaving an officer with a cut hand and a twisted ankle, according to the criminal complaint. The man was identified as Fabian Miller, 24, and was charged with assault and resisting arrest. He was released from jail after posting bail last week. A woman at his last known address, in Canarsie, Brooklyn, on Thursday said she had just moved in and he did not live there. Mr. Hassanian called it a night, but he was soon back on the corner, unafraid after what he saw as a freak event. ''I work in the street,'' he said. ''I need to work. I'm young.'' But he never told his wife. ''I don't want anybody to worry for me,'' he said. Follow The New York Times's Metro coverage on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the New York Today newsletter.

After a practice or before a game, many indulge in video games, a movie, a book or the ever-popular nap. A day off might include all of the above. But Pat Connaughton, a rookie with the Portland Trail Blazers, has a method all his own. On a nice day, he slips on a baseball glove, goes outdoors and plays catch with his father. It is no ordinary catch, though, and it is not solely for relaxation or familial bonding. Connaughton, a lithe 6-foot-6 shooting guard with a smooth jump shot and a rocket arm, throws with a purpose. He might go to a remote park around Portland, Ore., with his father, Len Connaughton, a real estate manager. Pat Connaughton loosens up from a close distance for a while, then throws 120 feet on a line and then moves in to 60 feet, firing 90-mile-per-hour lasers that slice through the air. ''Some guys take naps,'' Connaughton said last week before a game against the Knicks. ''As busy as we are and as focused as we are at our sport, there are times the coaches want you to get away from basketball. If my dad's not around, then I'll go out and throw against a fence.'' Connaughton, a gregarious 23-year-old with high aspirations, is not throwing only for recreation, though. He is like any pitcher readying himself to enter a game -- the only difference is that the game is two, three, maybe 10 years away. ''Even if I have a successful and plentiful N.B.A. career,'' he said, ''someday I am going to go back and try to be a big league pitcher.'' Later Tuesday night against the Knicks, Connaughton briefly played for the first time in six games. The next night, in a game in his hometown, Boston, he had 7 points while playing 7 minutes 45 seconds, each figure a career high. Connaughton does not play much. Few second-round draft picks do. For many observers, including the hopeful Baltimore Orioles, baseball is Connaughton's better sport. ''He has the talent to be a top-of-the-rotation guy,'' Rick Peterson, the Orioles' pitching coordinator, said in Sarasota, Fla., on Friday. ''He has a major league arm, but just as important, he is a major league person, and that is a prerequisite. He has everything it takes.'' Peterson helped usher in a golden pitching era in Oakland with Tim Hudson, Mark Mulder and Barry Zito. He also worked closely with Pedro Martinez and Tom Glavine with the Mets. But when he watched Connaughton throw a bullpen session in Sarasota in summer 2014, he witnessed something he had never quite seen before. ''His fastball looked like no other fastball,'' Peterson said. ''It has the most unique late movement I've ever seen.'' That bullpen session was shortly after the Orioles had drafted Connaughton in the fourth round of the Major League Baseball amateur draft. That summer, in six games during a brief turn with the Class A Aberdeen IronBirds, Connaughton had an eye-opening 2.45 E.R.A. over 142/3 innings. Then he was off to Italy on a trip with the Notre Dame basketball team, followed by his senior year with the Fighting Irish. Connaughton played both baseball and basketball at Notre Dame, but after graduation, he told the Orioles that basketball was his preference. He adores the sport, and he had to see if he could make it. Contrary to many predictions, he was drafted -- 41st over all by the Nets. He was immediately traded to the Trail Blazers, whose general manager, Neil Olshey, is considered a top talent evaluator. In order to sign his rookie contract, Connaughton had to give up professional baseball for at least two years, although he said Portland was fine with his light throwing program. After two years, the Blazers say, Connaughton can petition to have that condition reconsidered. That is why he continues to play catch. Peterson and Chris Correnti, an Orioles trainer who has worked closely with Martinez and Johan Santana, gave Connaughton the Orioles' standard off-season throwing program to follow in his free time. Connaughton also stretches out his arm every night to help keep it in shape. ''I understand assets,'' he said. ''My arm is an asset, and I need to take care of it.'' Connaughton relishes a challenge, especially overcoming doubters who said he would never be drafted in the N.B.A., that Notre Dame's 2-point loss to Kentucky in the Midwest Regional final of last year's N.C.A.A. tournament was his basketball peak. It very well may not be. But to date, Connaughton's N.B.A. journey has been unsurprising for a second-round pick. He gets most of his playing time in practice as a member of the scout team. In real games, he is averaging 3.0 minutes and 0.8 of a point. He has played in only 25 of the Blazers' 64 games. Yet even that is more than most expected. ''No one thought I would be here,'' he said. ''You see people say: 'He should go back to baseball. He should do this; he should do that.' Those are people who said I would never even make it here. There's always another hurdle to go over, and it's fun to use that as motivation.'' If he develops into a solid N.B.A. player, Connaughton could gain the leverage needed to play both sports professionally, the way Chuck Connors, Dave DeBusschere and Danny Ainge once did. Connaughton is no longer an Orioles employee, but the team retains his rights in case he returns to baseball. So when Connaughton heard that a reporter was soon headed to Orioles camp in Florida, he smiled. ''Tell them I said hello,'' he said with a playful wink, ''and I'll see them shortly.''

It has also become a target for poachers. Last October, at a conference in Las Vegas with thousands of corporate executives and software developers in attendance, A.W.S.'s chief, Andy Jassy, strode before an intentionally poorly disguised image of Lawrence J. Ellison, founder and chairman of the Oracle Corporation. Foot-tall words like ''bullies,'' ''extorted'' and ''strong arm'' appeared next to Mr. Jassy and the image of Ellision. The logo of Oracle, one of the biggest companies in Silicon Valley, was barely crossed out. ''Our marketing team needs work on redaction,'' Mr. Jassy joked. Better cloaked was the reason for his enmity: Oracle had been slow to get into the cloud business, but recently made multiple hiring raids on A.W.S. Both Oracle and Amazon declined to comment on Mr. Jassy's dig. The hunt for the hard-to-find talent that can build and run the massive data centers behind cloud computing is pitting three generations of companies against one another. Old-guard companies like Oracle, tech's current giants like Amazon and its peers, as well as Bay Area start-ups are offering big salaries and big perks for cloud computing experts. On the social media site LinkedIn, for example, there are over 130 engineering positions available at Oracle Seattle. Many of them are the kind of jobs that now pay $300,000 to $1 million a year, according to Shannon Anderson, who has been recruiting engineers in Seattle and the Bay Area for 25 years. Seattle and its surrounding towns are a hot spot for this kind of tech talent because they are home to A.W.S., which runs the biggest cloud computing service, and Microsoft, which has a large cloud business called Azure. Google also has a cloud computing office in the area. So does Facebook. ''Someone working deep inside Amazon is getting five to 20 recruiting offers a day,'' Ms. Anderson said. ''Compensation has doubled in five years.'' For a recruiter, who is typically paid a percentage of a star engineer's compensation, ''this is a very good time,'' she said. Cloud computing, which powers an increasing number of our devices and services, allows a vast collection of computers -- often spread around the world -- to operate like one giant machine. These computing clouds are being filled with once unimaginable amounts of data from apps, websites and sensors on all sorts of things. Fast-growing online services like Snapchat run on cloud systems. Apple has its own cloud, as does Facebook. Cloud systems even offer the computing muscle needed for things like artificial intelligence. As other tech sectors show signs of slowing, cloud services have created unprecedented demand for highly educated engineers and mathematicians who can build and operate these flywheels of data. Instead of asking about the latest computer coding languages or how to make a web page load faster, the most important question in tech hiring has become: Can you handle petabytes? That is the data in about 13 billion images, or roughly the amount of printed information that would fit in 20 million file cabinets. In the Bay Area, $125,000 a year is not an uncommon salary for someone newly out of graduate school with the expertise to do cloud computing work. With five years of experience, $300,000 along with a range of stock or job opportunities that greatly inflate the value of those paychecks have become the norm. ''It's an aggressive market,'' said Corey Sanders, director of program management at Microsoft Azure. ''We are all data engineers now, and we can convince people that this is the best place to learn that.'' The ability to deal with so much data has also become important to industrial companies like General Electric in figuring out things like jet engine maintenance schedules. G.E.'s pitch to cloud computing experts: We offer a chance to rebuild the industrial world. In the last three years, G.E. has hired 1,500 software developers and systems engineers, and trained a similar number of existing employees to work on cloud systems connected to everything from smartphones to wind turbines and jet engines. ''We've hired from every large company, places like Amazon and Google, as well as start-ups, or out of schools,'' said William Ruh, the head of G.E.'s cloud business. ''We pay well, with attractive benefits, a life and a chance to work on the mission to remake American industry.'' Still, he said, ''I'm totally shocked at how fast compensation is moving up.'' For smaller companies, the gold rush is more complicated. In San Francisco's South Park neighborhood, Tom Chavez runs a company called Krux that scans data from more than three billion devices, creating a trove of seven petabytes of information retrieved by several hundred companies. Many of his 160 or so employees are just the kind of people the giants, along with other start-ups, are looking for. ''LinkedIn or Facebook can offer an engineer with a few years' experience a package close to $1 million,'' said Mr. Chavez, who co-founded Krux and is its chief executive. ''We wanted someone out of Stanford for an internship, and Google offered her an annualized $180,000 for the summer,'' or about $45,000 for three months. Facebook also wants employees like the people Mr. Chavez has hired. In fact, Vivek Vaidya, a Krux co-founder, calls the steep salaries Krux is compelled to pay ''our Facebook tax.'' Krux takes up several floors of a brick building at the base of South Park, a onetime place of sweatshops that has filled with start-ups and venture capitalists. On the ground floor, development engineers get daily calls asking if they want to jump ship. A nearby team of data scientists gets 20 or more unsolicited emails a week via LinkedIn. Upstairs, Krux's recruiter strives to keep people, even as he looks to take from others. ''I can't compete with a $50,000 signing bonus from Google, so I focus on the person, what really motivates them,'' said Cade Garrett, who has recruited about 100 people to Krux. Besides offering stock options that could be valuable if the company has initial public offering, a fast-growing start-up can offer younger engineers a crash course in technology -- the kind of training that could one day allow them to start their own companies. ''I tell them this isn't the best-paying job, but they have to think about where things are going: Everything they do here is mission critical,'' Mr. Garrett said. ''You go to Google, you can't be sure that in a couple of years you'll have a product to show.'' Mr. Chavez thinks industry titans like Larry Page, the chief executive of the Alphabet holding company that includes Google, are intentionally driving up salaries. ''If I was Larry, I'd do the same thing: throw a few more million at people and cut off everyone else's oxygen.'' Even so, Mr. Garrett tries to keep engineers' contact information off the Krux websites to foil recruiters. And he is more than happy to do his own poaching. Zenefits, a fast-growing online employee-benefits company currently reeling from the departure of its founding chief and a round of layoffs, is a target. ''Absolutely, I'll call into any company that is in trouble,'' he said.  URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/technology/tech-companies-new-and-old-clamor-t o-entice-cloud-computing-experts.html"

This is no puffed-up claim. With close to $130 million in prize money available in 2016, tennis continues to provide paydays like no other women's sport. See the $3.3 million that Flavia Pennetta earned for winning the 2015 United States Open. The sport has also produced a steady stream of truly global stars with staying power, from Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova in the WTA's early years to Maria Sharapova, who may not play much longer, and Serena Williams. But it is just as clear that the WTA is on borrowed time when it comes to global leadership. Women's soccer, a still-drowsy giant, continues to stir. Soccer is a team game with fewer barriers to entry than expensive, technically daunting tennis, and with an estimated 30 million players worldwide, it already has a larger amateur base. The money should eventually follow, even if professional leagues are still struggling for footing. The international reach and societal resonance of the women's game are potentially huge, and it seems symbolic that when the latest FIFA women's soccer and leadership conference opens on Monday in Zurich, the keynote speaker will be none other than the tennis trailblazer Billie Jean King. ''It's not like they don't know it, but I think this is their moment of truth because of the corruption and all the things they've had to deal with lately,'' King said of FIFA, soccer's governing body, in a telephone interview last week. ''And I am a big believer, when there's a crisis, there's opportunity. It's a moment to have historic transformation at FIFA, and I will make my case.'' King intends to argue that expanding the women's game and increasing women's influence on the game should be a big part of that transformation. And with Gianni Infantino, FIFA's newly elected president, expected to be in attendance, King will apparently be preaching to the converted. ''The future of soccer belongs to women,'' Infantino said last month as he opened FIFA's new museum. King, 72, has made so many cases through the years when it comes to women's rights: from the founding of the WTA to her battle-of-the-sexes victory over Bobby Riggs to the creation of the Women's Sports Foundation to the continuing fight for enactment of Title IX, the United States law that provides -- in theory at least -- equal access to collegiate sports for women. Although King declares herself an unreformed optimist, there are undercurrents of bitterness. It has been a lifelong tussle, and while progress is evident, the pace of change in the women's sports movement and the women's movement at large has been a frustration. ''People don't care about us as much, and I'm talking about enthusiasm on the outside,'' she said. ''I'll give you a perfect example. Obama, being the first black president, everybody was beside themselves. ''With Hillary,'' King continued, referring to Hillary Clinton, ''they could care less that she's going to be the first woman. O.K., I don't care about their personalities. I realize Obama is much easier-going. Hillary even said it. She said: 'Look, I'm not Bill Clinton or Barack Obama. I definitely don't have their wonderful, warm personalities, no question.' She said it very truthfully, which is very refreshing when people are always truthful and specific. And you know no one is excited about that.'' This is, of course, debatable. A Clinton victory in November would certainly be viewed as a breakthrough in many quarters, but King, who expresses eagerness for it, also sounds impatient. ''I'll probably use this line; I use it a lot,'' she said of her Monday speech. ''When you read about history, you think it's gone very fast, but when you live it, it's very slow. I'm 72 now, and look at how slow everything is.'' She pointed to the continuing disparity in women's and men's earnings for equal work, the continuing economic struggles of women of color and the big gap that remains in female and male representation in the United States Congress. ''I think it will take another 150 to 200 years, probably,'' she said. ''But you have to keep fighting for it. Each generation has to do their part.'' Still, some generations have an opportunity to do more, and in sporting terms, which are hardly the most important terms, this generation of women's soccer leaders clearly has a window -- all the bigger with FIFA's new leadership eager to forklift the organization out of the mud. Gender equality sounds a whole lot better than widespread bribery. In one of his first official acts as FIFA president, Infantino will open the conference Monday, and he is expected to follow the panel discussions, which are set to include Abby Wambach, the recently retired American star; Sunil Gulati, the president of U.S. Soccer; and Moya Dodd of Australia, a soccer official who has been the driving force in the recent push for women within FIFA. It can be considerably more fun and affirming to ride the growth curve than to try to shore up the status quo. Giving women's soccer a boost was a big part of Infantino's campaign platform, and there has been structural change under duress as well. Reforms passed shortly before his election now guarantee six women on the enlarged, 36-member FIFA council. ''His manifesto is beautiful; I've been reading it,'' King said of Infantino. ''I think the one-up we may have, and this usually helps a lot, is that he has four daughters. And I'm hoping that I can reach his heart and reach the heart of others who have daughters because that's when we get help.'' King is no soccer expert. She said, surprisingly, that she did not watch much sports these days, but she has been an occasional mentor to some of the pioneering American professional players, including Julie Foudy, the sharp Stanford-educated former midfielder. King said she had counseled Foudy in the push for more income and influence for the United States women's national soccer team. This time, King sought advice from Foudy on what she should say to FIFA. Although her speech was still a work in progress last week, her thesis was already clear. ''It's about our culture; it's about women, and what does it say to the world?'' King said, her familiar voice rising.

Two New York State assemblymen plan to introduce a bill on Monday that would raise taxes on state residents who benefit from the lower rate, to precisely offset the tax savings they receive at the federal level. In addition to correcting what its members see as a glaring inequity in the tax code, the coalition hopes to generate revenue that could be spent on public investments in areas like schools and economic development. ''People from Buffalo, when they work, they pay their taxes,'' said Assemblyman Sean Ryan, one of the two Democratic legislators who are sponsoring the bill. ''We don't have a lot of hedge funds in Buffalo, but we do have a need for state assistance.'' The bill would make the tax increase contingent on the passage of corresponding legislation in Massachusetts, New Jersey and Connecticut, so that fund managers could not avoid the tax by simply moving to a nearby state. Those who helped draft the bill estimated that it could raise roughly $3.7 billion a year in New York if the tax increase were to go into effect. The coalition includes groups focused on reducing inequality and challenging the political power of the wealthy, such as the Patriotic Millionaires and Hedge Clippers. Hedge Clippers is backed by the American Federation of Teachers and targets the influence of hedge funds and private equity funds. The coalition plans to push for similar legislation in California, Illinois and Pennsylvania. The name of the so-called loophole refers to a feature of the compensation of many fund managers, who frequently receive a management fee equivalent to 2 percent of their fund's assets, as well as 20 percent of the fund's profits (sometimes contingent on reaching a certain profit threshold). The latter is known as ''carried interest.'' The effort to change the tax treatment of carried interest, long a priority of progressive Democrats in Congress, has attracted support across the political spectrum in recent years. Two Republican presidential candidates, Donald Trump and Jeb Bush,  proposed such a change last year. Despite this growing support, however, Congress has repeatedly declined to make the change. ''It is not just ridiculous and unfair, it is the kind of thing that has led to the rise of Donald Trump,'' said Whitney Tilson, a hedge fund manager and member of the Patriotic Millionaires, who has long opposed the tax provision despite personally benefiting from it. ''When you tell the average person what's going on here, it makes them so mad they can't see straight,'' he said. ''They turn to someone like Trump who confirms to them that the whole system is corrupt.'' Some of those involved in this latest effort say it was inspired in part by the campaigns to raise the minimum wage on the state and local level, another step Congress has declined to take on the federal level despite widespread support for the idea among voters. ''It's absolutely modeled on that,'' said Michael Kink, a leader of the Hedge Clippers who helped write the legislation that will be introduced in New York. ''A lot of people around the country are demanding action, and there's absolutely no action in Congress.'' As written, the legislation does not include a provision to end the state-level tax if Congress were to change the federal law. But Assemblyman Ryan said he would insist on that being the case, and some of the bill's supporters said it would be critical. Assemblyman Jeffrion L. Aubry, the lead sponsor of the forthcoming bill in New York, noted that legislators in Albany were engaged in the annual budget process, a time when many of their priorities frequently go by the wayside for lack of revenue. He suggested that the ample revenue the bill would generate could help build support for it. Still, enacting the tax appears to be a long way off, and supporters concede that the effort is as much about raising public awareness about the issue as it is about changing tax rates. ''How many people know what the word 'carried interest' is?'' asked Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. ''That's part of why they're so successful. They create names for things that no one understands.'' Under the current law, the federal government treats carried interest as long-term capital gains, which are mostly taxed at a rate of 20 percent for the wealthy, rather than as ordinary income, which would generally be taxed at a rate of 39.6 percent for this group. (An additional tax of 3.8 percent also typically applies to capital gains.) Opponents of this approach say that carried interest is simply compensation for services rendered -- in this case, managing other people's money -- not investment gains. That is because the share of profits that fund managers receive through carried interest does not derive from money they have personally invested. As such, opponents say, it should be taxed as ordinary income. ''I'm sorry, you're selling a service; that means it's labor income,'' said Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts who is a longtime opponent of the current approach. Representatives of industries in which fund managers earn carried interest deny that this tax treatment amounts to a loophole. They say that even if the managers' share of their funds' profits is not a return on money they have personally invested, it is compensation for the ''sweat equity'' they invest in building their businesses. They say their situation is analogous to sales of Facebook stock by the company's founder, Mark Zuckerberg. He pays the capital gains rate, even though outside investors provided most of the company's capital. Private equity fund managers should also pay the capital gains rate, they say, on profits from the sale of a portfolio company, even though others provided most of the capital for purchasing it. ''Private equity fund managers are more than money managers,'' said James Maloney of the Private Equity Growth Capital Council, an industry group. ''They hire executives, sit on boards, develop strategic plans.'' But many tax experts say even that logic is a stretch. The argument for taxing Mr. Zuckerberg at a lower rate ''is that there's an undersupply of entrepreneurs, and the world needs more Zuckerbergs,'' said Victor Fleischer, a professor at the University of San Diego School of Law, who writes occasionally for The New York Times and has advised the coalition on its revenue estimates. ''You can't make the argument that there's an undersupply of venture capitalists or private equity fund managers.''

ARE Americans having a hard time making up their minds? We can't decide. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton won the biggest share of delegates over the last week but Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders have done well enough to keep the race going. If you ask me, this is cause for celebration: the longer it takes, the better. I speak as someone with a serious commitment to indecision. There I was, in 1992, an uncommitted delegate to the Maine Democratic State Convention that May. The race was murky -- Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa had won his home state, Senator Paul Tsongas had won in New Hampshire and Gov. Bill Clinton's resurgence as the ''Comeback Kid'' had begun. In Maine, we were still trying to figure it all out. At our caucus, back in February, we'd all split into groups -- one for Jerry Brown, the former governor of California, two others for Mr. Clinton and Mr. Tsongas. And then there was my group -- the Fightin' Fence-Sitters. People in the Brown corner were eating chocolate-frosted doughnuts. ''Come on,'' said one, urging us over. ''Join us!'' My feeling was that the undecideds should hold their ground, and statewide the uncommitted slate actually edged just ahead of Mr. Clinton. By the time the state convention came around, I thought, we'd be power brokers. I imagined Mr. Clinton, Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Brown begging for our support, bargaining and pleading with us. My fellow undecideds and I would use our considerable leverage to pressure someone else to join the race -- Mario Cuomo! Ted Kennedy! Pat Moynihan! Who knew? Our commitment to indecision then wasn't just an obstinate reluctance to make up our minds. It was about dissatisfaction with our choices, and the hope that instead of making the wrong choice in a hurry, we might take the extra time to find a better one. By the convention, however, it was all over, or nearly. Mr. Tsongas dropped out in March; Mr. Brown would quit after losing the California primary in June. And the undecided caucus showed up at the Bangor convention irrelevant and unnecessary. All I could think of were those doughnuts. We sat on the sidelines, watching the floor demonstrations for Mr. Brown, Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Clinton, exasperated with the other delegates' sense of certainty, a little jealous of how much fun they were having. The Brown supporters were clearly having the best party. They whooped and hollered and sang; they were old hippies and young progressives excited by the idea of changing the world, even if the odds of putting any of Mr. Brown's ideas into law seemed long. His slogan that year was ''Take Back America!'' The Tsongas supporters seemed glum, in comparison to the Brown party, not least because their candidate was out of the race. They were on the floor chanting the humble slogan ''We Like Paul!'' They were nice people, a little embarrassed by all the fuss. Then they sat down. When the Clinton people came onto the floor, they weren't shouting ''We Like Bill,'' or ''Take Back America.'' They chanted: ''Beat George Bush!'' (this being Bush 41, who, although no longer enjoying the 89 percent approval he'd scored during the first Persian Gulf war, still seemed the favorite). The sense was that no matter what we felt about Mr. Clinton, he was still our best bet: the pragmatic choice. But as I watched the Clinton delegates on the convention floor that year, it occurred to me that what I really wanted was a demonstration on behalf of the uncommitted. Why didn't we get to cheer? ''We Aren't Sure!'' our signs might say. But there aren't any parties for the undecided. Americans hate the idea of having to wait until all the facts are in before making up our minds; we would rather make a decision, even if it's for something we haven't thought out very well, than dwell in ambiguity a moment longer than necessary. This is why people wind up with misspelled tattoos (''Im Awsome'' or ''No Regerts!''), or married to people they met at Burning Man. ''The best lack all conviction,'' wrote William Butler Yeats, ''while the worst are full of passionate intensity.'' In 2016, as in 1992, Republicans seem poised to reward the passionately intense. I do not know if Donald Trump is ''the worst,'' but one thing he does not seem to lack is conviction. It's moments like these that I yearn for a national movement on behalf of the uncertain. Because taking extra time to consider our most important choices is always a better option for a democracy than simply leaping into the abyss. Otherwise, we might well wake up one morning in January 2017 to find a president who doesn't know anything. Except that he is Awsome. I'm not certain of much, but I do know this: That's the choice that will fill us with Regert.

But Tina Fey's war dramedy ''Whiskey Tango Foxtrot'' was a dud, taking in roughly 25 percent less than even the weakest of prerelease analyst projections. ''Zootopia,'' conceived as a throwback to 1970s-era animated Disney movies like ''Robin Hood,'' collected about $73.7 million at North American theaters, an astounding result, especially for a nonsequel. To compare, ''Frozen'' had $67.4 million in first-weekend ticket sales in 2013. ''Zootopia,'' which is expected to draw crowds through the Easter holiday (it co-stars a bunny), cost an estimated $150 million to make. Second place went to ''London Has Fallen,'' which took in about $21.7 million, according to comScore, which compiles box-office data. A sequel to ''Olympus Has Fallen,'' which had $30.4 million in initial ticket sales in 2013, ''London Has Fallen'' was independently financed for about $60 million and released by Focus Features. ''Deadpool'' (20th Century Fox) was third, selling about $16.4 million in tickets, for a four-week domestic total of $311.2 million. ''Whiskey Tango Foxtrot'' (Paramount) made do with about $7.6 million in ticket sales, continuing Ms. Fey's box-office struggles when she has tried to expand beyond pure comedy. Analysts had projected results of $10 million to $12 million. This movie, which had soft critical support, cost $35 million to make and comes amid a cluster of similar dramedies. (''Rock the Casbah'' was one; the coming ''Army of One'' is another.) Continuing to fare poorly was ''Gods of Egypt'' (Lionsgate), which rounded out the top five, with about $5 million in ticket sales, for a two-week total of $22.8 million. Of note: ''Spotlight'' (Open Road), which was named best picture at the Academy Awards, expanded into more theaters and pushed past $40 million in total ticket sales.

Bell still stands out as one of the ugliest. The case may not be as well known as, for instance, Dred Scott v. Sandford, which denied African-Americans citizenship. But in just five paragraphs, the court upheld a statute that enabled the State of Virginia to sterilize ''mental defectives'' -- specifically one Carrie Buck, a young resident of the Virginia Colony for Epileptics and Feeble-Minded. The year was 1927. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote the 8-to-1 majority opinion. The penultimate paragraph concludes with one of the most notorious epigrams of American law: ''Three generations of imbeciles are enough.'' Yet as Adam Cohen, a former editorial board member at The New York Times and the author of ''Imbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck,'' points out, there were a number of problems with this decision quite apart from its manifest inhumanity. To begin: Ms. Buck was neither epileptic nor feebleminded. As time would prove, she was of perfectly average intelligence. She was simply uneducated and luckless -- a poor white girl from Charlottesville who'd had a baby at 17, most likely because she'd been raped by the nephew of her foster mother. Rather than risking scandal, her guardians thought it best to get rid of her. Even by her doctors' coldblooded calculus, Ms. Buck was only a ''middle grade moron.'' As medieval as that sounds, it was a genuine taxonomic distinction developed by the psychologist Henry Goddard, whose pyramid of feeblemindedness featured ''idiots'' at the bottom, ''imbeciles'' in the middle and higher-functioning ''morons'' at the top. Nor was Ms. Buck part of three generations of so-called imbeciles. Her mother, Emma, was committed to the same colony as her daughter a few years earlier without being administered an intelligence test. And her daughter, Vivian, was barely 8 months old when a Red Cross social worker decided she was ''deficient,'' explaining to a lower court that the baby had ''a look about it that is not quite normal.'' None of this mattered. At the time of Ms. Buck's institutionalization, the United States was swept up in a mania for eugenics. Part of the obsession was driven by xenophobia: Nativists feared that the sudden influx of immigrants from southern and Eastern Europe would make thin gruel of hearty American stock. But the movement, because of its supposed reliance on science to improve society, also found champions in the progressive and intellectual elite, including Alexander Graham Bell, Margaret Sanger and Theodore Roosevelt. And eugenics was of particularly keen interest to doctors, including Albert Priddy, the superintendent of Ms. Buck's institution. ''He saw it as the best way to rid the world of the sort of patients he spent all of his days ministering to,'' Mr. Cohen explains. His patients, in his view, were miserable -- and a future burden on the state, sure to lead to an uncontainable problem of ''pauperism and criminality.'' Of all the tools to stem the tide of feeblemindedness, sterilization was by far the most efficient. During the Progressive Era, a number of states had enacted compulsory sterilization laws, including California and Connecticut. So bullish was Dr. Priddy to do the same for Virginia that he worked in concert with a methodical, meticulous local lawmaker, Aubrey Strode, to design a statute that would withstand the test of the highest court of the land. Ms. Buck was the test case. ''There was only one problem,'' Mr. Cohen writes. ''Carrie had no idea what was going on.'' An unsuspecting innocent, an ambitious country doctor, a nation briefly infatuated with a despicable ideology -- these would all seem to be the elements of a captivating narrative. Yet ''Imbeciles'' is often a boggy read, and a disorganized one at that. Mr. Cohen, now a senior writer at Time magazine, repeats himself early and often, which suggests that the basic outline of a propulsive story eluded him. (Strange, given that he's written brisk, readable narratives before, including ''Nothing to Fear'' and ''The Perfect Store.'') He takes the reader down a couple of biographical sinkholes, giving us pages of back stories when a simple paragraph would have done the trick. Most crucially, he writes as if he's retrying Buck v. Bell. But we already know the decision was an egregious miscarriage of justice -- it was the unenlightened product of an unenlightened time. And the case itself was unsuspenseful. The fix was in from the start. We learn early on that Ms. Buck's lawyer, Irving Whitehead, had close personal and professional ties to the Virginia Colony for Epileptics and Feeble-Minded -- the superintendent paid his legal fees -- which meant he made no efforts to mount a serious defense for his client. He never called on Ms. Buck's teachers to confirm that she'd acquitted herself well in school; more fundamentally, he never asked Ms. Buck to testify on her own behalf. His petitions for appeals were always brief and incomplete, making insufficient use of precedent. ''He was an impostor,'' Mr. Cohen writes. What this means, from the reader's point of view, is that although the courtroom scenes involving Mr. Whitehead are tragic, they are utterly devoid of drama. By the time the case made its way to the desk of Justice Holmes, himself an eager eugenicist, readers are hardly surprised by his chilling opinion. Nor are they surprised that his Supreme Court colleagues, many of them enthusiastic race purists, overwhelmingly sided with him. Mr. Cohen repeatedly denounces the decision: Holmes could have ''probed the factual record'' to determine whether Ms. Buck was feebleminded; he could have looked at the expanding literature of the biological sciences, which had begun to challenge the basic assumptions of eugenics; he could have thought through the psychological consequences of sterilization for a young woman like Ms. Buck. All of which is true. But Mr. Cohen, a Harvard Law School graduate, surely knows that Supreme Court justices aren't in the habit of scouring the record for facts they were never presented. It's simply not part of their job. What I wish Mr. Cohen had done was spend more time on the American obsession with the feebleminded -- which is by far the richest, most fascinating, most horrifying aspect of his book -- and less time in the courtroom. Our research on eugenics was so sophisticated that we became the envy of the Germans; our Immigration Act of 1924 earned praise from no less than Hitler in ''Mein Kampf.'' In his introduction to ''Imbeciles,'' Mr. Cohen says Buck v. Bell ''is little remembered today.'' But that's not true, really: Mention the case at a midsize cocktail party of lawyers, and many will come back with ''Three generations of imbeciles are enough.'' But ask whether they know that Hitler praised our state sterilization laws -- now that, to most of them, would be news.

The country is still a military superpower and an economic and innovation powerhouse, but so many of our institutions are proving to be either fundamentally flawed or deeply broken. This thought kept creeping into my mind as I watched Thursday's Republican presidential debate in Detroit. It seemed to me the zenith of a carnival of absurdity, as the candidates descended into what appeared to be a penis measuring contest. I kept thinking with dread, ''One of these men might actually be the next president'' -- either the demagogue from New York, the political arsonist from Texas or the empty suit from Florida. (I see no path for the governor from Ohio.) In another political season, liberals might greet such a prospect with glee. But this is not that season. On the Democratic side, the leading candidate is a hawkish political shape shifter, too cozy with big money, whose use of a private email server has led to an F.B.I. investigation, and who most Americans don't trust. (Around two-thirds of Americans don't trust either party's front-runner.) Her lone opponent is a self-described democratic socialist who seeks to cram sweeping generational changes -- hinged on massive systemic disruptions and significant tax hikes -- into a presidential term. And he says that he will be able to do this with the help of a political revolution, one that has yet to materialize at the polls. One of these people will be the next president of the United States. And this is the country of which they will take the helm: We are a country stuck in perpetual warfare that is now confronting the threat of the Islamic State terrorist group. The Republican candidates have proposed the most outlandish approaches to that threat, including everything from war crimes such as torture and killing terror suspects' families to carpet bombing in the Middle East until we can see whether ''sand can glow in the dark.'' Our government is broken. We have a legislative branch that increasingly sees its role as resistance rather than action. There is an opening on the Supreme Court that Republican leaders in the Senate, in a breathtaking and unprecedented move, are saying they won't let this duly elected president fill. The appointment may fall to the next president. But that same Supreme Court has ruled that money is speech, swinging the door wide open to allow to the ultrawealthy to have nearly unlimited influence on the electoral process. No wonder a 2014 study found that America has effectively transformed into an oligarchy instead of a democracy. And yet, that is an idea that most Americans are pathologically incapable of processing. We suffer from a blithe glacialism, occasionally cursing the winds that carry our demise, but mostly hoping against hope and pretending that evidence of things seen and felt is either faulty or fleeting. It is not. We have millions of undocumented immigrants in this country, but comprehensive immigration reform remains a thing we bicker about but never move on. Our infrastructure is in shambles, but in a country where the bridges are crumbling, Republican candidates are obsessed about building a border wall. The city of Flint was poisoned as officials sought to pinch pennies. Global warming continues unabated, most likely intensifying the severity of extreme weather -- from droughts to hurricanes to blizzards -- and yet last month the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the Obama administration's rules to limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. Our educational system, from pre-K to college, serves the wealthy relatively well, but leaves far too many without access, underprepared or drowning in debt. We are plagued by gun violence and mass shootings and yet no one is moving forward on meaningful solutions. America's middle class is shrinking. According to a December Pew Research Center report: ''Fully 49 percent of U.S. aggregate income went to upper-income households in 2014, up from 29 percent in 1970. The share accruing to middle-income households was 43 percent in 2014, down substantially from 62 percent in 1970.'' Our criminal justice system has made a mockery of the concept of equal justice with its racially skewed pattern of mass incarceration. Not only is the United States ''the world's leader in incarceration with 2.2 million people currently in the nation's prisons or jails -- a 500 percent increase over the past thirty years,'' according to the Sentencing Project, but the group also points out: ''More than 60 percent of the people in prison are now racial and ethnic minorities. For black males in their thirties, 1 in every 10 is in prison or jail on any given day. These trends have been intensified by the disproportionate impact of the 'war on drugs,' in which two-thirds of all persons in prison for drug offenses are people of color.'' The list of woe is a mile long. There is palpable discontent in this country among those who feel left out and left behind in the bounty of America's prosperity. How long can the center hold? How long can the illusion be sustained? How long before we start to call this the post-American idealism era?

The singer Fantasia Barrino threatened to kick off her shoes during a soulful tribute to Patti LaBelle, one of the night's honorees for her musical work; the crowd roared with applause after Melissa Harris-Perry, the former MSNBC weekend morning host, presented the public service award to Eric H. Holder Jr., the first black attorney general, who was selected by the first black president; and more than $100,000 in ticket proceeds was raised for My Brother's Keeper Alliance, an initiative started by President Obama that aims to help disadvantaged boys and young men of color. ''Ultimately, BET is home for us,'' Kyemah McEntyre, a teenage fashion designer whose Instagram post of her African-themed prom dress went viral last year, said in an interview. She was one of this year's ''Next in Class'' -- a group BET highlights as representing the next generation of ''black excellence.'' ''It's amazing to be able to go to a place specifically for you, and where you get to see some positivity,'' she said. In addition to Ms. LaBelle and Mr. Holder, the honorees included Mellody Hobson, president of Ariel Investments and board chairman for DreamWorks Animation, who received the corporate citizens award; L. A. Reid, the chairman and chief executive of Epic Records, who was given the entertainment business award; and Lee Daniels, the filmmaker and co-creator of the show ''Empire,'' who was recognized for his television and film work. They were each honored with a statue and a tribute from someone whose career had been touched by his or her achievements. For Mr. Reid, that included a performance by Usher, who said that the executive was important ''for black culture, for music, for entrepreneurship in the South.'' For Mr. Daniels, it was a rendition of ''Man in the Mirror'' by Jussie Smollett, who on ''Empire'' plays Jamal Lyon, a gay character inspired by Mr. Daniels's own background. Mr. Smollett's performance also included images of protesters holding up signs that read ''Black Lives Matter'' and ''End Racism.'' The show, which will be shown on March 14, was taped a week after the Academy Awards, which had come under fire for a lack of black nominees in the acting categories. The former talk show host Arsenio Hall, who hosted the BET Honors show, talked about why it was special for black viewers. When the Temptations song ''Just My Imagination'' started playing during a brief production break, it seemed as if nearly all the audience members sang along. ''You don't hear that at the Oscars,'' Mr. Hall said.  URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/arts/television/bet-honors-pay-tribute-to-patt i-labelle-lee-daniels-eric-holder-and-others.html"

(PHOTOGRAPH BY VALERIO MEZZANOTTI FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES),7-Mar-16,,,,FASHION DESIGNERS (90%); FASHION SHOWS (90%); HAUTE COUTURE (79%); FASHION & APPAREL (78%); MEN'S CLOTHING (73%),"PARIS -- The most anticipated debut of Paris Fashion Week took place in a white box of a padded sound stage in the far reaches of the 15th Arrondissement as a cold wind blew in from the Seine. Guests trooped down a staircase covered in industrial gray carpet against the soundtrack of air raid sirens, to see Demna Gvasalia, the Georgian fox in the iconoclastic Vetements henhouse of fashion, unveil his Balenciaga. A hush of expectation settled over the crowd. Of course, Mr. Gvasalia had planned it that way. The location he chose, after all, was a soundproofed room. That was not a happenstance. A palpable calm and level of control was the single most defining factor of Mr. Gvasalia's first collection for the house Cristobal built. After an inconsistent three-year stewardship under the former creative director Alexander Wang, it was also a much-needed reboot. Though Mr. Gvasalia's work with the collective Vetements is often referred to as revolutionary (how much so is debatable), there was nothing radical about this Balenciaga. Indeed, Nicolas Ghesquière, who defined the house for the contemporary consumer for 15 years until he left in 2012, was arguably more extreme in his experimentalism; his relationship to the legacy of Balenciaga more conceptual than concrete. But by drawing on the architectural approach of Balenciaga the man, as well as the visual language he created -- the cocoon coat, the sac dress -- and combining them with the wardrobe elements of today, Mr. Gvasalia wrested the brand into 2016. Opera coats became puffa jackets and trenches, the collars spread to frame the clavicle, shoulders dropped and pulled into peaks at back. Button-down shirts, denim jackets and pea coats were cut on the slant and curved into the shape of a chrysalis, and suits in houndstooth and tweed had the hips triangulated out and up, like a false front, in an echo of the classic couture silhouette (shoulders slouched forward, stomach sucked in, bones sharp as steel). If the latter pieces may be difficult to wear -- most women do not want their hips as a focal point -- and if stirrup pants (an unfortunate trend at the moment) and multi-print paisley and floral scarf dresses with matching jacquard boots were less successful, strapless evening sheaths in silver sequined flowers or embroidered velvet with a kick pleat over one knee had a refined rigor. As a whole, the collection was clear in antecedent and concise in effect. And though there were some clear Vetements-isms on view in the play on proportion and awareness of the everyday, it briskly allayed the fear that Mr. Gvasalia would smash the Balenciaga name and heritage to the ground. Instead of being intimidated by the house's heritage, he embraced it and made it his own. With this risk, a reward. Check out our complete Paris Fashion Week coverage here.

108,The New York Times,7-Mar-16,Emory Gets Rare Copy of Abolitionist Appeal,Late Edition - Final,,"BOSTON, MA, USA (90%)",By JENNIFER SCHUESSLER,ENGLISH,Brief,,UNITED STATES (90%),Section C; Column 0; The Arts/Cultural Desk; Pg. 3,"MASSACHUSETTS, USA (90%); NORTH CAROLINA, USA (79%)",Newspaper,,,342 words,,7-Mar-16,,,,SLAVERY (90%); LITERATURE (78%); RACISM & XENOPHOBIA (77%); RACE & RACISM (77%); LIBRARIES (76%),"David Walker's ''Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World,'' published in Boston in 1829, was the first sustained attack on slavery and racism written by a black person in the United States. It's also a rare item today, with only a half-dozen early copies, and two first editions, listed in library catalogs. Now, Emory University has acquired what it says is a seventh, previously unknown early copy -- a first-edition that once belonged to W.E.B. Du Bois. The 76-page pamphlet, which was acquired from a private collector, is signed by Du Bois on the title page and the front fly. It also includes score marks DuBois made alongside dozens of passages, ''many of them incendiary in nature,'' according to the seller's description. Walker, who was born to a free black mother and enslaved father in North Carolina around 1785 and later moved to the North, self-financed the publication of the appeal, which called for slaves to revolt against their masters, even at the risk of death, and argued that America belonged more to blacks than to whites because ''we have enriched it with our blood and tears.'' The appeal's call to arms was considered too radical even by many of Walker's fellow abolitionists and caused widespread alarm throughout the South, where copies circulated despite efforts at suppression. While its immediate impact was soon overshadowed by Nat Turner's rebellion in 1831, the pamphlet's influence endured well beyond the passing of slavery. (Walker died in 1830.) In ''Dusk of Dawn,'' published in 1940, Du Bois called it the first ''program of organized opposition to the action and attitude of the dominant white group,'' praising its call for ''ceaseless agitation and insistent demand for equality.'' Kevin Young, the library's curator of literary collections, said, ''The book is testament to a line of black protest and prophecy that stretches from Walker to Du Bois to #blacklivesmatter.'' He added, ''Seeing it and the markings, it's almost as if Du Bois's lines in the text make that literal.'' JENNIFER SCHUESSLER"

The word ''processing'' lingered on his laptop's display for what felt like an eternity. Then the program offered the answer a human might have given instantly: ''Yes.'' Mr. Socher, who clenched his fist to celebrate his small victory, is the founder of one of a torrent of Silicon Valley start-ups intent on pushing variations of a new generation of pattern recognition software, which, when combined with increasingly vast sets of data, is revitalizing the field of artificial intelligence. His company MetaMind, which is in crowded offices just off the Stanford University campus in Palo Alto, Calif., was founded in 2014 with $8 million in financial backing from Marc Benioff, chief executive of the business software company Salesforce, and the venture capitalist Vinod Khosla. MetaMind is now focusing on one of the most daunting challenges facing A.I. software. Computers are already on their way to identifying objects in digital images or converting sounds uttered by human voices into natural language. But the field of artificial intelligence has largely stumbled in giving computers the ability to reason in ways that mimic human thought. Now a variety of machine intelligence software approaches known as ''deep learning'' or ''deep neural nets'' are taking baby steps toward solving problems like a human. On Sunday, MetaMind published a paper describing advances its researchers have made in creating software capable of answering questions about the contents of both textual documents and digital images. The new research is intriguing because it indicates that steady progress is being made toward ''conversational'' agents that can interact with humans. The MetaMind results also underscore how far researchers have to go to match human capabilities. Other groups have previously made progress on discrete problems, but generalized systems that approach human levels of understanding and reasoning have not been developed. Five years ago, IBM's Watson system demonstrated that it was possible to outperform humans on ''Jeopardy!'' Last year, Microsoft developed a ''chatbot'' program known as Xiaoice (pronounced Shao-ice) that is designed to engage humans in extended conversation on a diverse set of general topics. To add to Xiaoice's ability to offer realistic replies, the company developed a huge library of human question-and-answer interactions mined from social media sites in China. This made it possible for the program to respond convincingly to typed questions or statements from users. In 2014, computer scientists at Google, Stanford and other research groups made significant advances in what is described as ''scene understanding,'' the ability to understand and describe a scene or picture in natural language, by combining the output of different types of deep neural net programs. These programs were trained on images that humans had previously described. The approach made it possible for the software to examine a new image and describe it with a natural-language sentence. While even machine vision is not yet a solved problem, steady, if incremental, progress continues to be made by start-ups like Mr. Socher's; giant technology companies such as Facebook, Microsoft and Google; and dozens of research groups. In their recent paper, the MetaMind researchers argue that the company's approach, known as a dynamic memory network, holds out the possibility of simultaneously processing inputs including sound, sight and text. The design of MetaMind software is evidence that neural network software technologies are becoming more sophisticated, in this case by adding the ability both to remember a sequence of statements and to focus on portions of an image. For example, a question like ''What is the pattern on the cat's fur on its tail?'' might yield the answer ''stripes'' and show that the program had focused only on the cat's tail to arrive at its answer. ''Another step toward really understanding images is, are you actually able to answer questions that have a right or wrong answer?'' Mr. Socher said. MetaMind is using the technology for commercial applications like automated customer support, he said. For example, insurance companies have asked if the MetaMind technology could respond to an email with an attached photo -- perhaps of damage to a car or other property -- he said. There is still significant debate within the research community about the best technical approach and even what is the best way to measure progress. ''We are excited to see them joining the fray in question answering, but we think the data sets they chose are not ideal,'' said Oren Etzioni, a computer scientist who is chief executive of the Allen  Institute for Artificial Intelligence, in Seattle. In contrast, his laboratory is focusing on creating software that can answer questions taken from standardized elementary school science tests.

Snow delivered by train never figured into that image. But there it was, four or so inches of dirty snow with the consistency of sand, dumped overnight by trucks onto a downtown street for the 85 teams of sled dogs and drivers, called mushers, to parade through for the race's ceremonial start Saturday morning. The parade was only three miles long instead of the usual 11 because, despite the train delivery of tons of snow from Fairbanks, there still was not enough to go around. ''We've moved snow before,'' said Tim Sullivan, a spokesman for the Alaska Railroad, which brought down seven train carloads of snow for the festivities. But hauling snow to someplace that wants it? ''That's unusual,'' he said. Winter here is changing rapidly. Of the six warmest November-to-January seasons in Alaska since 1925, three have been in a row, including this one. Anchorage this year had its fourth-warmest February on record -- at 29.9 degrees, almost 10 degrees above average -- with little snow for weeks. Mushers, visitors and volunteers were divided about what to think of the imported snow. Gayle Overturf, 69, a health care giver who moved to Alaska last year from Arkansas specifically to experience an Alaskan winter, said she was saddened by it. But Kathleen Vincent, 48, a sixth-grade English teacher from the suburbs of Milwaukee, had the opposite reaction. She called it ''awesome.'' ''I was in there when they were dumping it last night,'' she said, pointing to a bar, Darwin's Theory, near the parade route. ''I came out and jumped in the snow bank.'' The race, formally known as the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, began Sunday from the town of Willow, about 50 miles north of Anchorage. In trekking nearly 1,000 miles to the finish line in the old gold-rush town of Nome, mushers and their teams commemorate an event that captivated the world in 1925, when a sled team, led by a dog named Balto, raced through blizzards to deliver lifesaving serum to Nome during a diphtheria outbreak. The rescue made headlines around the world, and earned Balto a statue in Central Park in New York. And since 1973, the competitive race has been run to celebrate that trek. Local historians say the race takes its name from the Iditarod River, which, in turn, means distant or distant place in the language of the indigenous people. There is $70,000 in prize money for this year's winner, according to the race organizers. Scott Janssen, who owns funeral homes in the Anchorage area, said there was little doubt in his mind that northern weather is rapidly and fundamentally changing, especially here. ''We've become Seattle,'' said Mr. Janssen, 54, who calls himself the Mushin' Mortician. He has finished the Iditarod twice in five attempts. ''We get snow and then, in the afternoon, it melts,'' he said. While it might sound paradoxical, milder weather does not make the Iditarod safer, easier or more predictable. For the 1,000 or so sled dogs, for example, heat is a much bigger concern than cold or even lack of snow, veterinarians and mushers said. The animals are bred and trained to run in harsh conditions and are happiest at temperatures of zero to minus 10. Even their diet during the nine days or so that it normally takes to complete the race is formulated to mimic the meaty diet that Balto knew. Just one sunny day in the 30s or 40s can raise concerns about overheating and dehydration for the dogs, said Stuart Nelson Jr., the chief veterinarian for the race. ''The biggest concern is overheating,'' said Dr. Nelson, who said that veterinarians examine the dogs at each checkpoint, and even conduct random urine tests to check for drugs such as painkillers or stimulants. To test for dehydration, doctors pinch a dog's shoulder skin: If it pops back into place quickly, all is well; if the skin returns more slowly, the dog is stressed. The doctors can pull from the race any dog they believe is not well. This winter has also lacked what Alaskans call ''deep cold,'' in the range of minus 50 or lower, which may have implications for the trail. No weather station anywhere in the state, even in traditionally frigid spots of the interior, like Fairbanks, has recorded anything colder than minus 30 this year. Spring arrives in two weeks, and if that mark stands, it will be the first time in at least 100 years that no place in Alaska saw winter temperatures fall to minus 50, according to National Weather Service records. Fewer days of such deep-freeze conditions creates the possibility of open water on the Iditarod course, which runs through the typical Alaskan bush mixture of rivers, bogs, lakes and swamps. ''It's not just the average, but the lack of any deep cold. And it wouldn't surprise me to learn about more open-water problems,'' said Rick Thoman, the climate science and services manager for the National Weather Service in Alaska. Mr. Thoman, who has raced sled dogs himself, added that while much of interior Alaska where the dogs will run has snow cover, it is old, weathered snow, left over from November. Many spots across the state are having their driest or second-driest winters on record. ''But the November snow is still there -- enough snow to run dogs on,'' he said. In any event, the sharp variability of the course's terrain -- and thus the need to expect the unexpected -- is probably going to be as ferocious as ever, said Stan Hooley, the chief executive of the Iditarod Trail Committee. Last year, for example, was so snowless in a crucial area of the Alaska Range mountains that the start of the race was moved to Fairbanks, 225 miles from its traditional beginning north of Anchorage. But warmer temperatures at the start quickly turned extreme when teams were caught in temperatures of minus 50, Mr. Hooley said. The racers are also adapting their strategies, he said, to a hotter, more variable Iditarod. ''What you'll see from a strategy standpoint is that many of the teams will rest much more significant amounts during the daylight hours, and do most of their traveling at night when temperatures are colder,'' Mr. Hooley said. He said dog health and safety drive those decisions, just as they did in the old days when survival -- not winning a race -- was the main consideration. ''The fact that we've got warmer temperatures means there's much greater emphasis by the individual competitors to make sure that the dogs are adequately hydrated, to deal with the stress,'' he said. Mr. Janssen, the funeral director, said he was prepared for any kind of race that might unfold, but that for now he was happy. Last year's race, starting in Fairbanks, went well. ''I love running on Fairbanks snow,'' he said.  URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/us/as-alaska-warms-the-iditarod-adapts.html"

Urban Outfitters, a clothing retailer for young adults that also runs the Anthropologie and Free People brands, is expected to report fourth-quarter results on Monday, and analysts expect lackluster earnings after a less-than-robust holiday season. In particular, weak sales at its core women's apparel segment probably offset growth driven by new categories, like home and beauty, at Anthropologie. The holiday was a mixed bag over all at teen retailers, as a lack of must-follow trends in apparel as well as warm weather for much of the season hurt sales of winter coats and boots. --Hiroko Tabuchi E.U. finance ministers to discuss curbing corporate tax avoidance. European Union finance ministers, at their monthly meeting in Brussels on Tuesday, are expected to try to reach a preliminary agreement on a law that would help curb corporate tax avoidance. The law would require companies to report their tax-relevant information in each of the bloc's 28 member states in which they operate. The idea is to dissuade companies, including American multinational corporations, from avoiding taxes by shifting profits to lower tax jurisdictions. The law under discussion on Tuesday would make the information accessible to the bloc's national tax administrations. But pressure has been building on ministers to devise additional steps to make the information public. --James Kanter Square's first full-year earnings since debuting on the N.Y.S.E. Square, the mobile payments company, is set to report its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings on Wednesday, a first for the company since it debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in November. Investors will pay close attention to the growth in Square's payments processing business, which generates the majority of its revenue. But close watchers of Square will also be looking at the performance of its ancillary businesses, including cash advances and subscription software products for small businesses. --Mike Isaac E.C.B. governing council to meet about Eurozone stimulus measures. On Thursday, the European Central Bank is expected to take further measures to stimulate the wavering eurozone economy when its Governing Council meets in Frankfurt. Analysts expect the central bank to raise the penalty it charges banks to store money in its vaults, and increase purchases of assets like government bonds to pump money into the eurozone economy. There is speculation that the central bank could go further in response to signs of slower growth in Germany and other countries by, for example, buying corporate bonds. Mario Draghi, the president of the central bank, will hold a news conference that day as well. --Jack Ewing  URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/business/earnings-from-urban-outfitters-and-sq uare-and-an-ecb-meeting.html"

Durex said there was no icon that communicated a desire for safe sex, so it started a campaign to provide one on smartphone keyboards. The consortium that sets standards for characters and emojis has yet to approve it, but the mere fact that Durex started the campaign prompted 210 million mentions on Twitter and, by Durex's estimates, drew 2.6 billion media impressions worldwide. Such is the power of emojis. And more companies are taking notice. ''There's a lot of brand demand for emojis,'' said Ross Hoffman, senior director of global brand strategy at Twitter, which recently started offering custom emojis for companies to use in advertising. That is because some 92 percent of the online population now uses emojis, according to a study by Emogi, a start-up that uses them to let people indicate how they feel about particular ads. Swyft Media, which creates alternate phone keyboards featuring multiple emojis, says people send six billion of them a day. Brands like emojis for several other reasons. For one, they reach ad-averse millennials, sailing past ad-blocking software. They are visual, which makes them a natural fit for popular messaging apps such as Snapchat and Instagram and also appeals to international audiences. And because they are meant to be shared, the brand images are distributed widely, free. ''All of a sudden, the brand is in this very personal conversation between friends and family,'' said Evan Wray, the chief executive of Swyft Media. Now, emojis are everywhere in marketing. When the Beatles catalog was made available on nine music streaming services in December, Spotify provided an emoji of the band's ''Abbey Road'' cover to people who used the hashtag #BeatlesSpotify on Twitter. That helped set Spotify apart; according to Twitter, its hashtag was mentioned in four times as many Twitter posts as the straightforward #Beatles hashtag. Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Starbucks, Disney and more than a dozen other companies have each paid Twitter more than $1 million for designs combined with various kinds of ads. During the Super Bowl, people who used the hashtag #PepsiHalftime got a reply that included a soda can emoji with musical notes floating out from it. For the Feb. 21 introduction of its new smartphone, Samsung rolled out on Twitter a custom emoji featuring its virtual-reality headset, along with several kinds of ads. For many companies, one emoji is not enough. Ahead of its annual Kitten Bowl animal adoption show before the Super Bowl, the Hallmark Channel offered an alternate phone keyboard developed by the mobile marketing company Snaps that featured ''cat-lete'' emojis such as ''Puma Esiason.'' Emojis are also spreading further afield in marketing. 20th Century Fox used them on a Los Angeles billboard to promote the movie ''Deadpool.'' IHOP Restaurants redesigned its logo in the style of emojis. Some companies have tried a little too hard to be hip. Last year, Chevrolet sent out a news release written entirely in emojis, perplexing many people. When Goldman Sachs used emojis to tweet news of its 2015 report about millennials on Twitter, the ploy backfired. One person commented on Twitter: ''@GoldmanSachs now explain credit default swaps in emoji pls.'' In Bristol, England, emoji-festooned McDonald's billboards were defaced with a vomit emoji. The bungles haven't slowed down brands' embrace of emojis. That is mostly because they convey emotion, the precious currency of marketers. Some companies are even starting to quantify those emotions to provide a more nuanced view of ad effectiveness than clicks or impressions. Emogi's ''emotion engine'' analyzes data on how people use emojis to reveal their sentiments about ads. Marketers can use that data to tweak campaigns or target promising audience segments, said Travis Montaque, the chief executive of Emogi. Not all companies can count on their branded emojis catching on. How many people really want to send (or worse, receive) the diaper brand Luvs' ''Momojis'' for diapers and baby poop? That is why some brands have attached themselves to more universal symbols. Taco Bell last year mounted a campaign for a generic taco emoji. A few months after the emoji became official last July, the company created a ''taco emoji engine'' that allows people to tweet the taco, along with another emoji. An automated program sends back one of 700 mash-ups of the two. Fans have used the engine 756,000 times since November. ''That's how Taco Bell could own it,'' said Winston Binch, chief digital officer at Deutsch, the lead agency on the campaign. ''It's not just a one-off ad, it's an ongoing connection with a brand.'' Other companies have devised more direct ways to profit from standard emojis. Domino's Pizza lets people order a pie by tweeting a pizza slice emoji. It's not that easy, since customers first must set up an online ordering account, and the company follows up with a Twitter direct message to confirm the order. Still, for its ''business-moving'' idea, the novel transaction system won the ad industry's top award for breakthrough marketing at last summer's Cannes Lions advertising conference. Of course, this could all be a fad. But many marketers think emojis are here to stay. Mark DiMassimo, the chief executive and chief creative officer of the agency DiMassimo Goldstein, said that emojis were likely to spread from messaging to social media and beyond. He cited Facebook's addition on Feb. 24 of five new emojis to its thumbs-up ''like'' symbol. Chevrolet promptly ran an ad for the 2016 Malibu suggesting that people tap the new ''love'' emoji on Facebook. ''The best uses of emojis haven't been done yet,'' Mr. DiMassimo said.

Unfortunately, by not including race and ethnicity in this metric, the Economic Innovation Group is telling only part of the story, and thus can point to only part of the solution. For example, the addition of data regarding the race and ethnicity of residents to this tool would reveal wide and persistent racial inequities, not just geographic ones, in educational attainment, poverty and unemployment. Recognizing this ''people'' dimension of poor neighborhoods -- and the complex interplay of race and place -- is essential for catalyzing equitable and sustainable economic prosperity for all. It is only by truly understanding the challenges that minority residents face in reaching their potential -- as students, workers, entrepreneurs and innovators -- that we can craft strategies to dismantle those barriers and connect them to opportunities to participate in and contribute to their local economies.

We are deeply affected by the loss of our spouses and at the same time our old and loving female friends. Those of us over 85 have to learn to make new friends when we have less to offer and more to lose in new relationships. Are we being welcomed because we still drive or have the energy to serve wine in the afternoon? Does that new friend seem too frail to go to the theater? Does a new acquaintance just speak haltingly, or is it a sign of mild senility? Yet many of us can and do join with women to play bridge, to read and talk about books, to play and sing music, and to work on civic and political projects together. When I leave these new friends, I recognize their loving importance to me, and we miss one another. Humans seem to thrive when they have meaningful relationships. The new friendships of the very old provide wisdom and emotional support for the shared dilemmas of physical decline, fear of intellectual diminution and also the real joy of continuing participation in life.

It is a physician who writes the prescription. Patients do not go to the pharmacy and order the medication. An endocrinologist should know to say, ''That new diabetes pill is O.K. but costs $600 a month, and a number of generics do about the same job.'' A podiatrist should say, ''Those drops to put on your toenail fungus cost $400 a month and cure less than 20 percent, while a generic toenail polish has about the same results and costs $10 a month.'' Physicians are too often obtuse about the cost of what they are prescribing, especially since they just had a nice dinner at the best local restaurant courtesy of the very same drug company, or they don't want to spend time defending the equal benefits of the generic. Patients may not like their TV-induced knowledge being questioned, and physicians may have to learn a little more and defend their actions with a brief talk (and even a reference to Internet use for more information). Physicians are not practicing good medicine if they cannot deal with misinformation in pharmaceutical advertising. West Orange, N.J. The writer is a rheumatologist. To the Editor: Elisabeth Rosenthal raises important questions about advertising by private hospitals and drug companies and the mass manipulation of patients. All these should be rightly placed in their proper arena, as growing public health concerns. The mix of greed and the facade of medical legitimacy have congealed in the form of avaricious health care advertising campaigns. In our political climate, as Republicans promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act and as Democrats debate the merits of a single-payer system versus an expanded version of Obamacare, it is discomforting to see that Big Pharma is keeping its watchful eye on the proverbial ball: manipulate public opinion, misinform patients about alternatives, drive up prices and privatize well-being through fear. It's been a winning formula so far. How about just being honest with people about options in their most vulnerable of times, when they are ill? Brooklyn To the Editor: Does it escape notice that these ads have the same characteristic attributes -- rapidly spoken disclaimers and unreadable fine print -- as used car ads do? Why are members of the medical profession not profoundly ashamed that they have allowed this second-rate hucksterism to dominate the media? Money, of course. Medicine was a profession; now it's a business. May the new generation coming into medicine lead it back to higher ground. Vieques, P.R. To the Editor: We greatly enjoy the drug ads. Amid the chaos and violence of TV, these ads are often lovely visuals of couples walking on the beach, boating on the lake, exploring the village arts fair and other pleasant idylls. Of course, we have no idea what medication is being touted. Our TV remote control has this ''mute button.'' We recommend its use for fast relief from chronic A.T.C. (annoying TV commercials). Perhaps we need more ads urging people to ''ask your doctor if diet and exercise are right for you.'' (Disclaimer: Diet and exercise may not be covered by all insurance plans.)

The dominance of megadonors in the election process means that they determine who runs for office and who doesn't, the narrative of election contests, and what policies are enacted or even considered legitimate. Most Americans perceive Big Money to be rigging the political system, and they are right. Remedies are at hand: overturning Citizens United and other Supreme Court decisions by constitutional amendment or a new jurisprudence; strong public financing measures for elections; stringent limits on outside spending; and robust contribution disclosure rules. While extensive polling shows that the public expresses overwhelming support for these measures, Congress fails to act. That's why thousands of Americans will pour into Washington from April 16 to 18 for the Democracy Awakening mobilization, to demand far-reaching action to get Big Money out of politics, as well as to protect voting rights and win an up-or-down vote on a Supreme Court nominee.

The businessman, Babak Zanjani, and two of his associates were sentenced to death for money laundering, among other charges, the spokesman, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejehi, said in remarks broadcast on state television. He did not identify the two associates. Previous reports in the state news media said the three had been charged with forgery and fraud. ''The court has recognized the three defendants as 'corrupters on earth' and sentenced them to death,'' Mr. Ejehi said. ''Corrupters on earth'' is an Islamic term referring to crimes that are punishable by death because they have a major impact on society. The verdict can be appealed. A news website run by the judiciary identified the associates as Mahdi Shams, a British-Iranian businessman who was detained in 2015, and Hamid Fallah Heravi, a retired businessman. Mr. Zanjani was arrested in 2013, shortly after the election of President Hassan Rouhani, who ordered a crackdown on alleged corruption during the eight-year rule of Mr. Ahmadinejad, his hard-line predecessor. Mr. Zanjani owes about $2.25 billion for oil sales he made on behalf of Mr. Ahmadinejad's government, Iran's Oil Ministry has said. The financial dealings of Mr. Zanjani, who amassed a fortune estimated at $14 billion, have also aroused suspicion in the West.

We made it to the Whitney -- Gansevoort Street a mute, abandoned set to a long-forgotten film. Inside the museum we were practically alone. On an upper floor we looked out through 30-foot windows as a raging gray and white painting silently formed, collapsed and formed anew. Behind us in the cool-white vault of museum space, Frank Stella's enormous, colorful sculptures screamed ''look at us'' without saying a word. The quiet continued into the night and next day. Our apartment began to feel like a log cabin, tucked in the folds of a mountain pass, with nothing to be heard near or far. Even the day after that, on a sunny walk to the top of a snow-covered Central Park Reservoir, we were surrounded by stillness as we looked south to the silhouette of the city -- a shadow of its noisy self. Now, I love the sounds of New York. The thriving hum of humanity striving. Buildings that bark and flirt for attention. The constant whispering of history everywhere. But oh, when the city falls silent, New York sings. Read  all recent entries and our submissions guidelines.

123,The New York Times,7-Mar-16,The Childhood Apartment in New Hands,Late Edition - Final,,"NEW YORK, NY, USA (91%)","By BARBARA W.

My sister (Ruth W. Messinger, the former Manhattan borough president) and I sort of had that experience. When my mother died in 2001, my sister and I had to sell the Upper West Side co-op apartment in which we grew up and in which my parents had lived since 1942. They had done almost no work on the place since about 1950 as far as I can recall. My sister, being the one who lives in New York City, went to the closing of the sale. All was going well when, as she reported, she told the buyer that there was ''one more little stipulation'' that she wanted to put in. His face fell. She said that she and her sister would love to see the apartment when it had been renovated. He kindly agreed, and a few years later when I was visiting New York, we called and he invited us over. It was lovely. They had been creative about making it a much nicer space, but they had kept all the (many) built-in bookshelves, which we loved and which, they said, had sold them on the apartment originally.

Our bucket truck blocks traffic. We're pruning in early February in the residential streets around Jewel Avenue, because a water main will be renovated here and the heavy equipment will wreak havoc on overhanging branches. Bob the pruner and I proceed block by block, inspecting the trees that need a haircut. He steps back on the ground first and takes in the whole shape of the tree, then hops in the bucket, zooms into the face of the canopy, grabs one or two of the branches to get them out of his face -- and, it seems, just to get the feel of them. Then he revs up his chain saw and goes to work. Despite the concrete and the asphalt and all the brick houses lining the street, I have the sense that we're making our way through a deep forest. The diversity of species is astonishing. The common ginkgo is uncommon here. There are massive pin oaks and diminutive, delicate plums, many red maples, heavy sycamores still holding aloft their pompom seed pods. Here there are cherries, sweetgums, London planes, lindens, zelkovas, crab apples. A few bald cypresses and eastern redbuds. A swamp white oak. In New York City? It's a veritable garden of specimens, an arboretum to rival the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. When Bob comes back to earth he is smiling, all thumbs up. It must look different from the height of a bucket. I'm going to go up there some day. Read  all recent entries and our submissions guidelines.
